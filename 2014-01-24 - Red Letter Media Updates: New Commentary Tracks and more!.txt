JAY:
Hi, everyone.
I'm Jay.

MIKE:
And I'm Mike.

JAY:
And we're here to tell you that we've got two new commentary tracks available.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
Full-length commentary tracks for Alien Vs. Predator and Samurai Cop are both available now.

JAY:
Where can people get these commentary tracks from, Mike?

MIKE:
I'm glad you asked, Jay.
You can get them on our Bandcamp page, which is accessible through our website, redlettermedia.com.

SPACE COP:
Are these Mr. Plinkett commentary tracks?

JAY:
Who is that?

MIKE:
No, sir.
They're not.
They feature me and Jay and Rich Evans.

SPACE COP:
Oh.
When's the next Plinkett review?

MIKE:
Well, actually, I read somewhere online that Mr. Plinkett is working on a new video review right now.

SPACE COP:
Ehh.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Just like my movie.
I'll believe that when I see it.

MIKE:
Well, speaking of Mr. Plinkett, he also has commentary tracks still available for The Phantom Menace, Star Wars Episode VI, and Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier.

SPACE COP:
Whatever.
Nobody cares.

JAY:
Mike, who is that?

MIKE:
That's Space Cop, Jay.

JAY:
Oh, Space Cop!
That's right.
We're also still shooting Space Cop.
And things are going smoothly.

SPACE COP:
The only crimes I care to solve are the crimes I can solve with my gun.
Or bomb.
Or crimes someone else can solve so I don't have to.

MIKE:
But, seriously.
We are still working very hard on Space Cop, building sets and shooting scenes whenever we can.

JAY:
All the while continuining to make new episodes of Half inthe Bag and Best of the Worst.
We also shot segments of Doc of the Dead, which will be premiering at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March.

SPACE COP:
Why don't you two get a real job?

MIKE:
He's right.

JAY:
He has a point.
