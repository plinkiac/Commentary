Jay:
Hello, and welcome to the Half in the Bag commentary track for Ghostbusters: Peace Sign. I'm Jay.

Mike:
And I'm Mike. 

Rich:
And I am the Keymaster. 

Jay:
Oh.

Mike:
Oh. That was just a big failure right off the bat.

Jay:
Just like Ghostbusters II.

Mike: 
Yes.

Jay:
Um, well, I guess, we should say right off the bat, rest in peace, Harold Ramis.

Mike:
Yes, of course.

Jay:
And we're talking about one of his, his lesser works, but I think we all still, uh, loved and admired a lot of things that Harold Ramis did, so... 

Mike:
Ghostbusters II is not one of them. Although he has his moments in this. 

Jay:
Egon's the best part of this movie. He has the best, uh, the best bits.

Mike:
But this is a terrible, terrible film.

Jay:
Would you call it a terrible film?

Mike:
Mmm, I know...

Jay:
It's the embodiment of how not to make a sequel. It's the exact same movie, uh, almost scene for scene. You can, you can look at scenes in this movie and pinpoint exactly the equivalent of that scene to the original.

Mike:
Yeah, exactly. All the plot points are identical. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Who, who outside of Dan Ackroyd and the studio wanted to make this movie?

Mike:
Uh...

Rich:
We know Bill Murray doesn't want anything else to do with the franchise. And I don't blame the man.

Mike:
Anyone who invested money into it. Wanted to make it too.

Jay:
And because audiences wanted it. 

Rich:
For sure. I mean, this is the movie they had to made the movie they necessarily wanted to make. 

Jay:
Yeah, it's interesting, because clearly, they had more money to work with the first movie made so much money. You would think like, especially with all the weird ideas Dan Aykroyd had before you know, the first movie got pared down to what it was for budgetary reasons. Like, you can take the Ghostbusters in so many different directions. Why have them repeat the exact same thing?

Mike:
These are all very good questions.

Jay:
We may never know the answer to them either.
Mike:'t one there is nobody involved with the movie cares enough to do a commentary. There are no special features of any sort for any release of Ghostbusters two.

Mike:
we got to remember to point out all the equivalency scenes. Yes, it was of course the old lady in the basement of the Public Library seen the opening, it's the opening tag, which most movies have the you know, the opening scene of a movie kicks it off.

Jay:
But actually, like the scene. I don't know. Why don't you like the scene?

Mike::
Because it's stupid.

Jay:
Do you elaborate?

Mike
It's dumb, some slime gun on the wheel of her carriage and moved it around to the point where they dig in the street later for no reason, which appeared to be a random spot above the river of slime for absolutely no reason. So, it was clearly a very terrible way to shoehorn in Sigourney Weaver's character for no reason whatsoever. 
Mike:
Jay:
Well, that's huge evidence that she's right in the heart of the threat of this movie.

Mike:
Because her baby carriage rolled over a random patch of slime that somehow got all the way up the street level. Even though later in the movie, it's clearly running in a river 700 feet below the street.

Rich:
And it's just randomly Dana Barrett. Yeah, it's not like it had to be Dana Barrett because it goes over it. 

jay
Or no everything in this movie happens so they can have it be the exact same things the first one.

Mike:
Other than the cube baby, the opening sequence is completely stupid.
Mike:
 This is the only good music in this movie. 

Jay:
Is it weird that the Ghostbusters theme song is now in the Ghostbusters universe? 

Mike::
Yes. I always thought that was odd. That's also weird that they changed their logo too. 

Jay:
That makes no sense completely. 

Mike
I don't know if that's considered breaking the fourth wall or what.

Jay:
I guess it would be their company though is not a sequel. 

MikeMike:
No. 

Jay:
They're just reopening their company. 

Rich:
It's stupid. I don't think anybody likes that logo. 

Jay:
No, no.

Mike:
When they update the car for the seat. and they have like. 

Rich:
No, it's not like Ecto two it's Ecto one. a lot of things in this movie are done for the sake of like the cartoon that was going on at this time. Like the cartoon had an Ecto two helicopter, so they couldn't call the actor one in this the actor two they had to call the One A.

Jay:
Oh, that is interesting. Yeah, that was well let me ask Do you guys remember seeing this movie for the first time? Do you remember what your reactions were when you first saw it? 

Rich:
I hate it. Why I remember hating the slime plant. I thought that was just retarded. Yeah. And just in general being led down after the first act. I love the first part. You see where like where they are now? 

Jay:
well, this That's what's interesting is like I like seeing where they are now but this would have been more interesting scene where they weren't if this was like a sequel made now, likeMike: right at this is only a couple years after the first one, it's done that the Ghostbusters are broke up and they have to get back together because just for the purposes of recreating the first movie again, like if this was like, Egon, you know, they're all retired from Ghostbusters. Now he's in the 60s, he's doing these weird experiments. Ray runs in a cult bookshop, like all that stuff would have been interesting if they were older. Right? But having happened right after the first movie is the lame way to just write the same script again. 

Rich:
Yeah, but this is one of my favourite scenes in both movies. 

Jay:Mike:
Yeah, I would agree here. I like this. Let's see what happens when we take away the puppy. Oh, yeah, all the that's the interesting thing about this movie. The script is incredibly stale, but there's lots of good bits in it. There's lots of funny moments.

Mike:
Yeah, mostly in the first act like Rich said love funny moments. But point for point. It's the exact same story like which it's just so frustrating. As you said they could have taken it in so many different directions. 

Rich:
ironically, the movie becomes stale. The moment they become Ghostbusters again. Which is evidence in my mind that they should never make Ghostbusters three. I mean, they really can't now.

Mike:
they'll remake Ghostbusters.

Jay:
That's the thing, there's in the wake of Harold Ramis his death, like the day after he died. Everybody was like we're still making Ghostbuster Three, like fuck you, assholes get you wait a month or so before jumping all over it.

Mike:
But I think it called three or?

Jay:
I think even if because there's been talk for so long that it'll be like passing the baton movie to these younger comedians or whatever. And the original members will have one or two scenes. But I think even if that is the case, they will not call it Ghostbusters three. They'll just call it Ghostbusters. 

Rich:
75% of what makes the first movie good, is the interaction between Dan Ackroyd Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. you can't pass the torch. It's just something different at that point. Mike:

Jay:
I think a lot of people would argue that it's like the Ghostbusters concept is what could keep it going without these actors. But I disagree with the reason that movie works like the movie is those characters. 

Rich:
It's half the equation about that. 

Jay:
More than that. 

Mike:
So, the first Ghostbusters movie is a fluke. 
Mike:
Jay:
It's lightning in a bottle. 

Mike:
Yeah, it was accidental almost. 

Jay:Mike:
Well, you hear about Dan Aykroyd 's original idea. And it was like this huge thing. And, that's going back to Harold Ramis. One of the things I like about him and this era of comedians, was such a collaborative effort. It was all these different people that are funny people contributing ideas and shaping it into what it ended up being. And that was true of a lot of the comedy at that time that all these guys were involved with.

Mike:
Yeah, and there are a couple of jokes in the first Ghostbusters that fall flat. And you could kind of see like, there's a couple of Peter Venkman bits that I was like, what you know.

Jay:
How would you say that about?

Mike:
Well, I'll get into it later but it seems like a couple of different approaches all that happened to work together on. Because, you see Bill Murray doing does his comedy stuff. It's inappropriate. And it's like, you get this idea like isn't it funny if there were like these blue-collar exterminator guys that that got rid of ghosts instead of pests and there's Apple angle? but that's a whole another = comedy movie. And it's like and then you have these serious plots about the interdimensional God that's trying to come to earth and all this stuff. And then the technology stuff like all those elements all melded together perfectly where could have been just as horrible disaster. Like the second one.

Jay:
Well, the second one is okay, the first one worked we don't want to take any risks. We're just going to make the same movie again. Yeah, just play it as same as possible.

Mike:
And those the thing with the first one is just it was just risks all over the place, everything. 

Jay:
that's what you wonder like the people that are still interested in seeing a Ghostbusters three, like they forget about Ghostbusters two. 

Rich
They don't understand why the first one works. Maybe they just want to see proton packs shooting and ghosts. That's all they really want. 

Jay:
I say if you want to see Ghostbusters three to look at examples of why that shouldn't be made. Look at one Ghostbusters two. And then look at Blues Brothers 2000. Like, just let it go. Just let it go. The most depressing thing about Blues Brothers 2000, is the very beginning before the movie starts. There's a title screen that says in memory of John Belushi, John Candy and Cab Calloway. Like the three most interesting aspects of that movie, they're all dead and we're gonna make the movie Anyway, and I fear if a Ghostbusters three happens, they'll say in memory of Harold Ramos, like, Oh, poor Harold Ramos.

Mike:
But I think the reason why this first act works is because it plays up those these three characters and they're there. They're sloppiness, they're awkwardness. They're like Bill Murray is a con man. He's doing his con man bit yeah Egan's a bizarre scientist who's out of touch with normal people. and raised in love with the occult and bookstore. He's obsessed with his craft and what he does. 

Rich
And nobody gives a fuck about Winston, so they don't really show what he's doing.

Jay:
They give him one scene early on, so you remember him. And then he disappears.

Mike:
Winston, Winston was just a gag in the first one, essentially.

Rich:
He's, I think he's in this, see, I think he's in this because of the cartoon.

Mike:
Yeah, sure.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich:
Winston does not need to be in this movie.

Jay:
He served a very specific purpose in the first movie.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: Which was to explain how all this science works-

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: --to the audience. He is the every guy. He has no real character, other than that. He's just a guy. Um, now we know how all this stuff works, and he's completely unnecessary

Rich: And the jokes over.
 
Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
I don't know. I think Winston's presence in the first one was some kind of bizarre, dated joke, like...

Jay:
Mmm.

Mike: Like, I think it was just sort of, like, they hired an extra guy, just, just--

Rich
It's funny that they just have this guy who is uninvolved.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
He's just a guy that they hired.

Jay:
He's just there for a pay check, yeah.

Rich:
And he's just with them.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich: That in itself is kind of funny.

Mike:
He's just some guy that got hired to help, and he knows nothing about what's going on.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah, but he works as explaining, like, they explain to him how the containment unit works, and all that. So, he has a story function as well. 

Mike:
You could use Peter Venkman's character in that regard, too, though.

Jay:
I suppose., I suppose.

Mike:
Like, Egon could explain to him what's going on, but...

Rich:
In this movie, he serves absolutely no purpose.

Mike:
That's true. A lot of things don't serve a purpose in this movie.

Jay:
I do like Janosz. He's a nice new addition, because he's something different, even though he serves the same story function as Rick Moranis in the first movie.

Mike:
Right.

Jay:
He's, he's weird, and I like him. He has some good lines. I think one of my favourite lines in this movie is when he -- it just happened -- where he says, "Everything you're doing is wrong. I want you to know this."

Mike:
I, I really like when, um, Venkman asks him, he's like, "Where's that accent from? Where are you from?" He's like, "The Upper West Side."

Jay:
Yeah, he's something different for this movie, when everything is so...

Rich:
They rip that off from Short Circuit.

Jay:
Oh, really?

Rich:
"Where are you from?" "Pittsburgh."

Mike:
Oh, really? 

Jay:
Oh...

Mike:
Oh, so, the Indian character.

Rich:
Yep.

Mike:
Well, damn you, Bill Murray.

Jay:
Bill Murray?

Mike:
Or, saying that that's an ad lib.

Jay:
No, he says the Upper West Side.

Mike:
Well, I know, but the joke, the joke...

Jay:
Oh, oh. Okay. Here's Vigo. Not quite as interesting a villain.

Rich:
He's such a letdown when he walks out of the painting.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
They should have had him walk out all majestically, and then trip and fall.

Jay:
No, I like that the villains in these movies are treated seriously .

Mike:
Of course.

Jay:
Like, even when he sayin his, like, "From the--", what is his big speech in this?

Mike:
Yeah, yeah.

Jay:
It's so goofy, but he plays it so straight, and it works.

Mike:
But unfortunately, he does nothing in the film.

Jay:
He does nothing in the movie, and he's -- the ending is horribly anticlimactic when they just kind of shoot him, and then that's the end of the movie. We'll get to that, yeah.

Rich:
Well, they didn't know what to do -- they didn't know how to end the first one either. I mean, I, as classic as "crossing the streams" is, it does feel tacked on.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
A little bit, yeah.

Mike:
That they're--

The movie's won, uh, you over by that point, so it almost doesn't matter.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah, all this stuff where they're not Ghostbusters is wonderful. It's so bizarre. It's very appropriate to the characters.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich:
And the characters is why the concept works, more so than the ghost packs--

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
--and the technology.

Jay:
And that's why, when people say like, "Oh, you could just have a new series of comedians. It's the concept", that's...I don't, it really isn't the concept. The concept's neat, but it's really these guys--

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
--and the way they, they handle all that stuff that sells it.

Mike:
Yeah. But we all know when they make a new Ghostbusters it'll be proton packs firing every two seconds.

Jay:
Yeah...

Rich:
They're going to look like s on their back, too.

Mike:
Yeah, good call.

Rich:
MM-hmm.

Mike:
Good call. They want it -- there, they'll be sleek, and black.

Rich:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
It'll be like the Robocop remake. It'll start like looking like this. And they'll say, "We got to upgrade!"

Mike:
Right. Oh, will the Ghostbusters car be, be something new now?  

Jay:
Mm.

Rich:
It'll have to be, yeah. Because they will have to change everything for no good reason. 

Jay:
Yeah. Well, speaking of things they'd update, this is, I didn't realise until recently: the first Ghostbusters, uh, Sigourney Weaver was, like, 36 when they made that movie. And the equivalent of her character -- if they made this now, as no studio would cast the 36-year-old actress -- it would be someone like late 20's, maybe 30 at the most.

Mike:
How old is Bill Murray here? 48?

Jay:
I know Harold Ramis was 40 when they made the first movie.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
And that's the same thing. Like, yeah, these guys are all too old. You can't have them as the leads in your movie.

Mike:
Right. But it's believable.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike: Because they're older dudes that work in, uh, a university.

Jay:
Mm-hmm.

Mike:
As frauds.

Rich:
The fact that they're schlubs is part of just what makes it work.

Jay:
Right.

Mike:
A conman. a scientist, and a schlub.

Rich:
"Back off, man. I'm a scientist."

Jay:
So, uh, oh, yeah, that's another thing, uh, they broke up. Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver broke up after the first movie, so they could have a romance blossom in this once again.

Mike:
Right.

Jay:
The only difference is that she has a kid.

Mike:
Yep. So, this scene of course, is the equivalent of the Bill-Murray-comes-into-our-apartment-the-first-time scene.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
And makes awkward advances on her, and pokes around with a little stick thing

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Yeah, exact same movie.

Jay:
This scene does feature my favorite Egon line, though, in either of the movies.

Mike:
Oh, the slinky?

Jay:
When he says, "I had part of a slinky, I straightened it." This, just trying to imagine the backstory of how he ended up with part of a slinky.

Mike:
Mm[-hmm.

Jay:
Where's the rest of it? Yeah, Egon's got the best stuff in this movie

Mike:
Yeah, they chose not to say, "I had a slinky, but I straightened it."

Jay:
Yeah. "I had part of a slinky..."

Rich:
It makes your, it makes your brain work trying to fill in the details. 

Jay:
Exactly, exactly. So, this movie came out in 1989. It was a big year for movies.

Mike:
Wait. It was, it was. Here is Venkman, he has to get the stool sample, which is exactly the same as Venkman having to scoop up the slime off, and...
Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Let's point out our complete parallelization. Yes, what you were saying Jay, summer of '89.

Jay:
Oh, yeah.

Mike:
The best movie summer ever.

Jay:
It was, like, Back to the Future II, um...

Rich:
Indiana Jones.

Jay:
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Was that Last Crusade?

Rich:
Last Crusade.

Jay:
The Last Crusade.

Mike:
Last Crusade was '89. Batman.

Jay:
Batman.

Mike:
Dick Tracy.

Jay:
I don't think that was '89, was it?

Mike:
That was the year, it was after, because they aped, like, the Batman...

Jay:
Yeah, that might have been '90. Uh, but the most important movie of 1989 that came out--

Mike:
Was UHF.

Jay:
--was UHF, yes.

Rich:
Was that '89?

Jay:
That was '89. Nope, '89. 

Rich
Oh, my god.

Mike:
And it flopped.

Jay:
That's why it flopped, because it came out against Ghostbusters II, Back to the Future II, all these big movies. But I probably rewatched UHF more as a kid than any of those other movies. Except for maybe Batman. I watched the shit out of Batman.

Mike:
I haven't seen Batman in a while.

Jay:
Yeah, I remember seeing this. This may be my first, like, like, cinematic disappointment, seeing this in the theatre as a kid. Where even as a kid, I was like, "This is the same movie!" Like, when I was old enough to understand things like that. 

Rich:
I just understood that it bored me. 

Jay:
It bored you. Well, I was actually, because, I was a big fan of the cartoon. I did like the cartoon a lot. But I was disappointed that the movie was doing things similar to the cartoon. I was like, "I wanted to see a sequel to the movie, I don't want to see the cartoon--"

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
"--in the theatre."

Rich:
Friendly Slimer.

Jay:
Friendly Slimer. Janine has a completely different character.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Now she's spunky and has bright red hair. And it looks just like she does in the cartoon.

Mike:
The giant glasses.

Jay:
The giant glasses. Yeah, in the first movie, she's just a board receptionist. And they set up a budding romance between her and Egon, and they ignore that in this one.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
For some reason. 

Rich:
Because they hook her up with Loius Tully.

Jay:
For no reason other than they wanted to put Louis in the movie.

Mike:
Yeah, Louis Tully needed something to do.

Rich:
Well, there's a, there's a whole subplot cut out with, uh, Louis Tully and Slimer.

Jay:
Oh, there was more to that?

Rich:
There was, Louis Tully has, like, three scenes where he's trying to catch Slimer.

Jay:
Oh, I didn't know that.

Rich:
And Slimer comically outwits him.

Jay:
Oh. At least they cut that. Actually, in rewatching this movie, because I haven't seen this in a long time, I rewatched it for this commentary, and I was actually pleasantly surprised at how little Slimer was in this. I remember him being in it more when I was a kid. I mean, like, "Slimer, why is he in this? They caught him!" Oh, because he was in the cartoon. And I liked the cartoon, but I didn't like that they were incorporating elements from the cartoon in the movie. None of the Ghostbusters smoke anymore.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
Well, this movie was made for the kids.

Jay:
Yeah. And I was a kid, and I hated that fact.

Rich:
Oh, sure.

Jay:
And it drove me nuts. There's a reason they're drilling the hole here. The Geiger meter, uh, directs them to that point.

Mike:
It peaked, it peaked. Yeah. It's where the baby carriage stopped.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
They're taking drastic actions, though.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich:
I do, I do like Bill Murray in this scene. 

Jay:
I, yeah, yeah.

Mike:
This is a good scene.

Jay:
This is a fun scene. It just doesn't, doesn't really make much sense. 

Mike:
When the Ghostbusters are underdogs, it's fun.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
And I don't know if this movie opened up with them being, like, you know, city work, like, city heroes, like what the Ghostbusters established, and all that.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
If it would be as fun, you know, the first act would be as fun--

Jay:
It probably wouldn't be, but there would be a different way to approach it. Like, they mention at the beginning of this movie that after the events of the first one, they got sued by, like, every organization, like, that's, that's great. That's perfect. But to have them just not be Ghostbusters anymore -- and also, the fact that nobody believes in ghosts anymore...

Mike:
Right.

Jay:
Like, that makes no sense.

Mike:
You're right.

Jay:
Like, after all the events of the first movie, a giant marshmallow man walked down the city streets, but no one believes in anything supernatural anymore. Like, did everybody just forget?

Mike:
Right.

Rich:
Because proof of the existence of ghosts would change the world too much. You still want to ground the movie in reality. 

Mike:
well, that's the thing, it, though, Ghostbusters wasn't specifically ghosts....totally. It was more interdimensional beings.

Jay:
Yeah, there's some monsters, and..

Mike::
Especially the ending. It was, like, like, an interdimensional god, like, just attacking the earth. So, it wasn't, like, uh, dead humans coming back to life, or anything like that. It was more of...alien kind of thing.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
So, but you're right, it would change society dramatically. And writing that thing into a sequel would be complex.

Jay:
But that couldn't make it interesting. I mean, there is, like, a certain level of sort of science element to these movies, too, so, you could explore that a little.

Mike:
They went and threw it all in the garbage...and listen to the people at the boardroom table who said this is the best way to make a whole bunch of money.

Rich:
Look, look, Jay, you make a plot about slime so you can sell jars of slime to kids. And you can also make a new backpack that they wear that the kids will want to buy that shoots slime.

Mike:
Yep.

Jay:
Did that happen? 

Rich:
Yep.  

Jay:
I don't remember that.

Mike:
They came up with the tanks that shoot the electrified slime or whatever. 

Jay:
That's what they shoot at the Statue of Liberty at the end. They had toys of that, though?

Mike:
Oh, yeah.

Rich:
They had toys of everything.

Jay:
I don't remember that. I remember tons and tons of toys from the cartoon.

Mike:
Super Soakers were probably popular.

Jay:
Oh, sure.

Mike:
And then they come up with the tank, and the kids can shoot the water out of the tank, and pretend to be Ghostbusters. With the proton pack toy, I don't know what that did. Didn't it havem like, plastic that spun around? 

Rich:
It had a, it had a foam thing in the front of it.

Jay:
Yeah, you could stick the foam thing, and then it would spin around.

Mike:
It didn't translate into a toy very well.

Rich: 
You don't need the foam. You just give the backpack, and you pretend you're shooting. You're a kid. 

Jay:
I had the proton pack, and that's what I did, yeah.

Rich: 
My proton pack, I got rid of the foam immediately.

Jay:
Yeah, me too.

Mike:
Yeah, yeah. That's true. We used our imaginations.

Jay:
I remember playing Ghostbusters on the playground as a kid.

Rich:
Every kid played Ghostbusters.

Jay:
It's true.

Rich:
Now kids just use cell phones.

Jay:
They use their Ghostbusters app.

Mike:
There's an app for that. The imagination app.

Rich: 
It tells you what to pretend. Is that how that works?

Mike:
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Rich:
I don't know how to play. What do I do? 

Jay:
And then it just brings up a movie, and then you just watch the movie. That's, that's the imagination app.

Mike:
Oh, lord.

Jay:
So, we're approaching the courtroom scene. Right? Isn't that after this?

Mike:
Yes.

Jay:
The courtroom scene is the equivalent of the Sedgwick hotel scene from the first movie. 

Mike:
Yep. The, uh, the, um, the scene that kicks it off.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
The end of the first act, 30-page mark on the script. And, uh...

Jay:
And I wonder with this, how much of it is, because I don't think anyone in the movie -- like, especially Bill Murray -- was, like, that excited about making this. And it kind of comes across. But I wonder how much of the script turning out the way it did is laziness on Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis's part, and how much of it is just the studio saying, "just give us the exact same thing."

Mike:
Were they the two screenwriters on this?

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Mike:
Hmm.

Rich:
Isn't Dan Aykroyd the one that absolutely loves the Ghostbusters, though? He's the paranormal freak in real life.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah. Yeah.

Rich:
I can't--

Jay:
But he's also the one that, especially around this time, he had so many ideas. Like, why would he just want to rehash the first movie?

Mike:
He, he probably got pushed down by studio people.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
I would imagine.

Jay:
They just said, "Just give us the first movie again."

Mike: 
Let's ask him.

Jay:
Let's call him up. Right now.

Mike:
We'll pretend we're going to talk to him about UFO's. I saw a UFO documentary with Dan Aykroyd on it, and the whole thing, he was, like, on the Skype. It was just terrible. Just babbling about UFO nonsense. 

Rich: 
I think I watched part of that, yeah. Yeah.

Mike:
So let's rope him in.

Rich:
You remember, do you remember back in the day, we used to joke about calling up Harold Ramis--

Mike:
Mmm.

Rich:
--and asking him that, "If you shot a living person with a proton pack, would their soul be caught in the stream?"

Mike:
He'd say, "Leave me alone. I'm trying to sleep!" Janusz. So Janusz loves Sigourney Weaver, just like Lewis Tully did.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Mike:
And then comes to her apartment door, and...knocks on it, and she won't let him in. Just like Lewis Tully did. This movie sucked.

Rich: 
Don't take any risks, Mike. Don't take any risks. 

Jay:
Yeah. The only movie I can think of that, that apes the first movie even more closely than this is, like, Teen Wolf Too.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
The only difference is that, uh, he's in collegeand--

Mike:
He's a boxer.

Jay:
--it's boxing instead of basketball. But other than that, it is the exact same movie.

Mike:
There's been proven successful track record of repeating the first movie and a sequel. You're doomed for your third one.

Jay:
Yeah, you can't repeat the same thing three times.

Mike:
I'ts like, uh...

Jay:
You can trick people with one sequel...oh, here's a bizarre thing. They introduce Winston in the scene, and then he just disappears from the rest of the scene. Where did he go? 

Rich 
You know, I, I've, I noticed that, too. But then, I, I, last night I read an explanation.

Jay:
Oh, really?

Rich:
There are only three proton packs on the desk.

Jay:
But where is he in the scene? 

Rich: 
He apparently, you can very briefly see him escorting people out. But it's, like, it goes by really quick. 

Jay:
Oh, okay. Maybe they shot a close up of it, and in editing, they just didn't end up using it.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Well, that's something, I guess.

Mike:
Thank you for that explanation.

Jay
That's been driving me nuts since I was a kid. So, it is nice to know that there is somewhat of a reason for it.

Mike:
And here we have the Walter Peck equivalent.

Jay:
Yes, yes.

Mike:
The man that hates the Ghostbusters for no reason.

Rich:
He's a bureaucrat.

Mike:
He's a bureaucrat. Walter Peck, at least, was working for the EPA, and--

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--and had some mild concerns about pollution, or...

Jay:
He, he had a motivation.

Mike:
He had some motivation. He was still a prick and hated the Ghostbusters for not much reason, but...

Jay:
Well, he, he tried to be as polite as someone like him could be in the situation. He comes to the station and asks sort of politely.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
He's still kind of a dick.

Rich: 
To be fair, Peter Venkman is a complete asshole to him.

Jay:
Yeah, exactly.

Mke:
"I want to know more about what you do here."

Jay:
Yeah, Bill Murray just completely shuts him down. And here, yeah, this character is just a dick. Played by Kurt Fuller, who played the same character in every movie around this time. He was in the Wayne's World movie.

Mike:
Mmm.

Jay:
That's, I would call that, sequels in general are tricky, and comedy sequels are almost always a failure. But I would say Wayne's World 2 is a successful sequel. I like Wayne's World 2.

Mike:
Mm. I don't, I don't, I don't remember the difference between the two.

Jay:
Wayne actually grows as a character in the second one. That's the problem, is usually, like, in a comedy, they'll have their little arc, and then the second movie, they don't know what to do with them.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
Like, look at the second Austin Powers movie. Like, that's the prime example of that, where the first movie, he learns to stop being a womaniser.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
He falls in love with the Liz Hurley character. And then, the second movie, in the opening scene, they just say, "Oh, Liz Hurley is a robot." Like, Jesus Christ. 

Mike:
Well, thos are

Jay:
I know they're goofy movies--

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
--but they do give them a little arc in the first movie. You have to give him somethin. And then the second movie, they just throw that completely out the window.

Mike:
Those are, those are set up and payoff joke movies, though. Just gag after gag after gag.

Jay:
Sure, sure, but, you know--

Mike:
With a mild plot.

Jay:
Yeah, you have to have a minor--

Mke:
Yeah.

Jay:
--character arc for your character.

Mike:
Minor.

Jay:
And the first one had that. And it's, it's, it's minor, but it is an arc--

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
--and then, to just completely throw that out the window in the second one, like, I, I like the second one okay, but--

Mike:
It's, it's--

Jay:
--that drove, that bugged me.

Mike:
You can't really compare an Austin Power-type movie to Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters, I don't see as, they're comedies, but it's, it's not that kind of comedy.

Jay:
No, I'm not saying it is, but, as far as like...
 
Mike:
If this was just gag after gag after gag, constant laughter--

Jay;
Sure.

Mike:
--like a Naked Gun movie, type movie, where it's just jokes and jokes..

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--where story doesn't matter that much. But this...

Jay:
The diverse array of thugs.

Mike:
All the thugs and extras.

Rich:
So, does this slime just summon ghosts, because they come out of the slime. It almost seems like the slime makes ghosts.

Mike:
Now why isn't the slime, it's, it's, it's not green because it's not ectoplasm.

Rich:
It's, it's purple because the slime they sold for the cartoon show was purple.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Oh, was it? Oh, man. You remember all these things from the cartoon that I don't remember.

Rich:
I loved the cartoon.

Jay:
I did, too. I don't remember it.

Rich:
I remember the toy was purple. The slime in the cartoon was, could be any color, I think.

Jay:
Okay.

Rich:
I know they sold purple slime.

Jay:
Really? Well, that explains a lot.

Mike:
Because it was cheaper to dye the slime purple than green. Is it that cynical in this movie? They probably didn't want to confuse it with the ectoplasm.

Jay:
But, yeah.

Mike:
Did they call it "ectoplasm", the slime?

Rich:
Uh...

Mike:
Because ectoplasm's a real thing, like, in paranormal-speak.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
It's, like, residue of ghosts, like... 

Rich: 
I'm pretty sure they call it ectoplasm, you know, I think they called it ectoplasm in the first one. 

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
They call it slime over and over in this movie, though, because that was a big line in the first movie, was "He slimed me."

Mike:
Yeah. But, ectoplasm in a ghost sense is different than this pink slime, this is, like, solidification of bad emotions, or something dumb like that?

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
So, it's different than the residue of, of ghosts.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mkike:
It's a completely different thing, but--

Jay:
But, yeah, it doesn't make no sense why a ghost would just emerge.

Mike:
Well, it's just slime, they just call it slime.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
And it's, is it unrelated to the, um, the Vigo character? I forget.

Jay:
It's, it's related, in a really sort of convoluted way.

Mike:
Yeah, but they show it painted on his painting.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.
 
Rich: 
How did it, did Vigo put it there, or is it coincidental that he's using it fuel himself, or...?

Jay:
Oh, look it, when these, when these guys were put to the electric chair, apparently their chairs died with them.

Mike: 
Mm-hmm. And they look like, uh, the Pillsbury Doughboy.

Jay:
If ghosts can wear clothes, they can have electric chairs.

Jay:
Okay, fair enough.

Mike:
Okay, yeah, so why do they come out of the slime--

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--is the question, cuz...I don't know. Because movie. Cuz, this, we need a scene that gets the Ghostbusters back into business. 

Jay:
Yeah, this is the equivalent of the Slimer scene in the first movie. Top-notch effects for the time, though.

Mike:
Yeah, those ghosts look too cartoon-y, though. They look right out of a cartoon show.

Jay:
Well, it, you could say that about Slimer. Yeah, you could say that about Slimer in the first movie, too, though.

Mike:
Well, sure.

Jay:
I, I like that a lot of the ghosts in the first movie are, like, there's that, uh, skeleton cab driver, and there's a lot of them that are more grounded in, uh, a realistic look. 

Mike: 
Well, the, the, um, the librarian ghosts.

Jay:
And the librarian ghosts.

Mike:
A classic ghost. And that, that was the way to do that. 

Jay:
Yeah. But, yeah, these look more like toys you would sell from the carton show. 

Mike:
Right. They should have looked more like old serial killer guys flying around.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
That wouldn't have been, scared little kids.

Rich:
This is the baby Ghostbuster movie.

Mike:
No, no sex jokes. No smoking.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
No, uh--

Jay:
But why not? Kids liked the first movie a lot. Why tame it down when the first movie had the same appeal?

Mike:
Because adults don't give kids enough credit to--

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--to separate things in their brain, or not understand things. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
You know?

Jay:
They're definitely was a shift from the early 80's to the late 80's. When you look at movies -- like, kids movies that came in the early 80's -- they definitely were darker--

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
--than where the decade ended.

Mike:
Do, Ray, Egon.

Jay:
People quote that a lot, and I, I never cared much for that joke.

Rich: 
Before the line at the end of the scene, uh, "Two in the box, ready to go..."

Jay:
Oh.

Rich:
"Because we be fast, and they be slow."

Jay:
See, I don't think I like that one either. It feels like they're trying too hard to come up with little catchphrases--

Mike:
Well, that, that's--

Jay:
--instead of letting them happen. And there are a lot of lines in this that feel natural, that are more quotable to me because they aren't, they don't feel like they're trying as hard. 

Rich: 
I don't think this is anywhere near as quotable as the first one. I can't think of any--

Mike:
No.

Rich:
-classic Ghostbusters 2 quotes.

Mike: 
There's a couple.

Jay:
There, there's a few. There's lots of good lines. I wouldn't call them like famous quotes, but there's lots of funny lines in it. 

Rich: 
Every, every line spoken on the first one is a famous quote now.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Mike:
"The flowers are still standing." Even when he does that...

Jay:
We're at that point in this movie, too.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
This is that same scene. And then it's immediately followed up with a montage -- music montage -- of them, uh, catching ghosts.

Mike:
They're suddenly back in business.

Jay:
Just like that.

Mike:
I guess you could say that with the first one though, like, suddenly there was a montage of them being back in business, but, um, the...

Jay:
Well, it's their business growing and the first one. And then there is an explanation as to why all this normal stuff is happening.

Mike:
Yeah. This one, I guess--

Jay:
I mean, there kind of is to do with the pink slime.

Mike:
The slime is getting more powerful...

Jay:
But it still doesn't explain how ghosts just come out of the slime.

Rich:
You're not supposed to care.

Jay:
You're just, "Oh, they're catching ghosts."

Rich:
Yep.

Jay:
And that's it.

Mike: 
This movie's insulting.

Rich: 
You know, as a kid, it always bugged me that they weren't wearing their uniforms during this scene.

Jay:
They're in a courtroom.

Rich
No! I was a kid. I wanted to see the Ghostbusters in their jumpsuits shooting ghosts, not in suits. 

Jay:
You'll see plenty of that later. You can still see that today, actually, if you go to a convention that Ernie Hudson is at. He actually wears the Ghostbusters uniform at conventions.

Rich:
Really? Huh.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Oh, that's, that's just sad.

Jay:
It's a little sad. It's a little sad.

Mike:
That's, that's the line that you should never cross--

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--as a, as a...uh-oh, now we're back.

Jay:
Apparently whatever job Janine had in between the first movie and this one, she felt it was worth giving up, so she could be a receptionist again.

Mike:
Yeah. The last, she wasn't working the last three years. Hey, there's the running-down-the-street shot.

Jay:
And then, oh, the sign, uh, uh, we visited the Ghostbusters fire station once, and they let them keep that sign after this movie. They have it hanging in the front of the building there. On the inside of the building. So that was kind of need to see.

Mike: 
That's right. We're back. All of a sudden.

Rich: 
With a slightly uglier car.

Mike: 
So there's the, I guess the slime seeping out, so that's--

Jay:
It's bubbling its way up to the surface, I guess. I like this ghost. The jogger ghost.

Mike: 
It was, it was a good bit.

Jay:
This is fun.

Rich: This, the music ruins this montage sequence for me now.

Jay:
Oh, do you not like the song?

Rich: 
I hate it.

Mike: 
Was this, like, the rap song, like, Ghostbusters--"

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
There's a number of those in this, yeah.

Rich:
The score in general is kind of bland in this. I don't know if I'd say bad, but--

Jay:
No, it's not bad. It's...

Rich:
It's no fucking Elmer Bernstein.

Jay:
No, it's off. I, I dunno.

Mike:
This is slightly different. This is this character seeing their TV commercial, as opposed to Sigourney Weaver seeing their bad TV commercial. So, although it's, I think it's probably edited with the exact same shots and pacing, where she, she wrote--

Jay:
This whole montage, or that bit?

Mike: 
Maybe the whole montage, too. Why not? 

Jay:
Okay. I do know that this bit here, where Ray runs a red light, was part of a longer sequence where Ray apparently gets possessed by a ghost or something.

Mike:
Oh, really?

Jay:
Yeah. And that was all cut out. I remember reading that somewhere.

Rich:
It's him possessed by the painting. Remember when he stares at the painting, and, uh--

Jay:
Oh, maybe it's related to that.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
That would make sense. What the fuck is that thing?

Jay:
I never understood this.

Rich:
It never shows up again.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
it doesn't show up again in the cartoons. It's just some weird Ghostbuster laser thing that is used only once.

Mike:
They, they did a thing with the traps. They're catching a ghost through stealing diamonds, or something.

Jay:
"Or something."

Mike:
I like that little thing. It makes you think, like they're doing some sort of whacky Ghostbusters trick.

Rich:
I'm just wondering what the fuck it is.

Mike:
Yeah. Oh, there is a scene where she watches the commercial, never mind. Except she's not exercising. She's feeding her baby.

Jay:
Oh, that scene in the first movie when the -- well, I guess that's later. That's not during the montage. But when she's sitting in the chair, and then the--

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
--the demon hands come out of the chair. Like, that's a prime example of scary scene that would not be in a kid's movie...by the end of the decade.

Mike:
Okay, so here's a little experimentation, see. What is the equivalency of this?

Jay:
Um, ooh.

Mike:
Explaining the, the--

Rich:
Research on Gozer, looking him up in the guide.

Jay:
Mm...

Mike:
Maybe, maybe.

Jay:
Yeah, not, not every single scene is a direct lift, but most of the main--

Mike:
Yes, it is!

Jay:
--expository scenes.

Mike: 
Damn it!

Jay:
No, no. Most of them. I'm not going to say every single one.

Mike:
Every shot is the same. I, of course, am being humorous.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
I know every scene isn't identical, but you lay down the, the plot points and the structure, and they would line up.

Jay:
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Mike:
Almost identically. Yeah, this is so cartoon show. You know, this scene. Winston there, hanging out, like, all he wanted to do in the first one was get paid.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
Now he's, like, he's helping investigate. Like, he didn't care at all before. He just wanted a job.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Yeah. Now he's a ghostbuster.

Mike:
Now he's a ghostbuster, just like the cartoon show.

Jay:
Although they do insinuate here, that Egon had sex with the slime.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Which is...fun.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Something that always bothered me as a kid about this toaster scene coming up -- and it's a minor nitpick but it bugged me -- they, uh, they pour the slime in there, and it dances around, and then two pieces of toast shoot out. Wouldn't toast have slime all over it? Where'd the slime go? 

Mike:
You should--

Rich:
The slime all went in the toaster, around the toaster. 

Jay:
The slime actually is, is, uh, uh, it has to avoid the toast. That's its weakness, the toast.

Mike: 
Yeah, wouldn't the toast come alive and start dancing, too?

Jay:
See, that would have been fun. Little possessed toast.

Mike:
So, they just got their firehouse back? Just like that? Or were they paying rent on it for three years.

Jay:
Five years.

Mike:
I guess they purchased it, right?

Jay:
They, they, yeah, they put out a third mortgage on, on Ray's house.

Mike: 
"At 18%, you didn't even argue."

Jay:
And that's an aspect of the movie, the first movie, I really love is...things I've appreciated about that movie...different things as I've gotten older.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Like, that's the most recent one is, all the, the detail put into, like, these schlubby guys trying to start a business. Like, I like that aspect of it.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Rich: 
You can identify with that. 

Jay:
Exactly. They get this, this, they start working in a dumpy building. All things I can relate to. 

Mike:
I like this. "Bassmasters."

Jay:
"You're my second-favorite show after Bassmasters."

Rich: 
And then, and then Bill Murray hates him after that.

Mike:
Mm-hmm. "It's a fishing show."

Jay:
"It's a fishing show."

Mike: 
"Yeah, I know best Bassmasters." Moments like that.

Jay:
Yeah. There's, there's lots of little moments that, that, uh, make this movie. What? That's not one of the good moments. The painting smirking.

Mike:
Why not?

Rich:
Eh, that doesn't bother me.

Jay:
No?

Rich:
No.

Jay:
Why does it do that?

Rich:
Because it's evil.

Mike:
Because he, he knows she recently had a baby, and he's, wants to get that baby--

Jay:
Mm...

Mike:
--to take, take over his body. 

Jay:
Because it has to be her baby.

Jay:
It has to be her baby. She has to be directly linked to the, uh, the main threat. 

Rich: 
Because she's a major character. 

Jay:
Yeah. Yeah, the simplest of things you could have changed. Like, she could have just been Venkman's girlfriend. Maybe they could have been married. Whatever. But not have her directly linked to the main plot.

Mike: 
Could have been Venkman’s baby. 

Jay:
Sure! So many, so many little tweaks you could do. 

Mike:
But you wouldn't, you wouldn't have the sexual tension. Like, the him-trying-to-win-her-over?

Jay:
Sure. Maybe they have a new bump in their relationship.

Mike:
Yep. You gotta stick with what worked in the first one...and recreate.

Jay:
Mm-hmm.

Rich: 
You know, Peter Venkman's an asshole, and I can't see any relationship working with him. He's a funny character, but in real life, he would just be a prick.

Jay:
Yeah, if you were to encounter him in real life, you would be, yeah. Fun fact: I didn't realize until recently, Vigo's voice, uh, it's not that actor's voice. It's dubbed over by Max von Sydow.

Mike:
Oh...

Jay:
I never knew that.

Mike:
Sydow.

Jay:
Sydow? Whatever. The Exorcist. I never knew that he dubbed over his voice until recently. I also did not know -- I found this out recently -- that this, uh, the VHS release of this movie, when it first came out on VHS, uh, there was a version of it that was letterbox. It was one of the very first letterbox VHS's. But it wasn't letterbox in the theatrical aspect ratio. It was a less-narrow aspect ratio, so they still did pan and scan. So, it was letterboxed and pan and scan, pleasing nobody. 

Mike:
Oh, no.

Rich:
It's like, like a spork.

Mike: 
Oh, no, not the scene. 

Jay:
This scene, I vividly remember seeing in the theater.

Mike:
Yes.

Jay:
Um, because there was some, like, drunk hooligans in the theater.

Rich:
Okay.

Jay:
And they started yelling, when she takes off her shirt, they started yelling, like, "Take it off!" And I was, like, there was my dad. It was horribly awkward. 

Mike:
I think this is, this is the moment, when they show the cartoon bathtub, that's the moment that lost me. I was, I was on board up until that moment.

Jay:
Oh, really?

Mike:
When the bathtub, like, is trying to grab her, and it looks like...so terrible. And I was like, "What?" And that, I think that was it. That was it.

Jay:
That was the moment you checked out.

Mike:
I was fine with the river of slime, and the painting, and all the other stuff, but it, it looks so terrible.

Jay:
See, I don't remember any specific moment, where I was, like, "Oh..." I just remember the movie overall, once it was over, like, it was the same movie. 

Rich: 
I know the rap montage started to dislodge me.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
I didn't, I didn't mind that. I didn't mind the music there.

Jay:
I didn't mind the music in this. The Bobby Brown song.

Mike:
"We're on our own..." And there's a Bobby Brown cameo, too.

Jay:
Oh, that's right.

Mike:
He asks Egon for a proton pack.

Jay:
For his little brother, right?

Mike:
For his kid brother. And Egon says, "The proton pack is not a toy." Uh-oh...oh.

Jay:
Oh.

Mike:
Slime. It's, everything's slime.

Jay:
Why is, why is he...laying down on the couch, sleeping on the couch in his clothes here? He looks like he's, like, hungover or something? I wonder if there was a scene that was deleted.

Mike:
Possibly.

Jay:
It's very, it's just an awkward way to--

Mike:
Have you, have you ever seen the deleted scenes from this? There's not on this. 

Jay:
I don't think they exist.

Mike: 
This is like a barebones DVD.

Rich:
I don't think anybody's seen them.

Jay:
Yeah. There's never been any sort of special edition of this movie. 

Mike:
Hmm...

Rich: 
I've, I've read about them. I've seen still images.

Mike:
Well, they release everything on Blu-Ray now. Like, why, why wouldn't they do a--

Jay:
I, I, I don't know. I don't think anybody cares about Ghostbusters 2. 

Rich: 
You could get away with it, though. People would buy it.

Mike: 
Yeah, sure.

Jay:
Yeah, I probably would, actually, ust because I'm curious.

Mike:
Even if they were, like--

Jay:
And I didn't even like the movie that much.

Mike:
--like, rough, crappy, you know--

Jay:
Sure.

Mike:
--unmastered versions of the scenes. I would be okay with it. Because the ones on the, the release of Blu-ray release of the first one are--

Jay:
They're in bad shape.

Mike:
They're in very bad shape.

Rich: 
I know, I know there's a lot of deleted Slimer stuff.

Jay:
Hmm.

Rich:
There's a deleted scene where they put the Statue of Liberty back.

Jay:
That was actually, in rewatching this, that was something I was curious about. There was a scene of that?

Rich: 
Uh, I don't know if it actually shows going back on the pedestal, but I know there's like, a ceremony by the Statue of Liberty, with dialogue and everything. 

Jay:
Oh, well, they show a little bit of that during the credits of this. When the credits are rolling, you seel it.

Rich
Yeah, they just pan up, and you see the, yeah. But it's like a shot, but I know, originally, it's like a whole scene.

Jay:
Okay. See, they're explaining there's a connection between Vigo and the slime. Of some sort.

Rich: 
But did he make the slime to go in New York City because he knew he was going to be in a painting in New York City?

Jay:
That's a very good question. And if he was stuck in the painting, how did he do such a thing?

Mike: 
Nobody knows.

Jay:
Did he know that New York City would exist someday?

Rich:
Yeah. These are all, these are all very good questions. I do you like the way Bill Murray interacts with the baby in the scene, though. I think it's cute.

Mike:
Does, can Vigo control ghosts? Because, doesn't he sound like the witch, Wicked Witch of the West?

Jay:
Well, that's, that's--

Rich:
No, well, I guess we'll get to the, should we wait till we get to that, or--

Jay:
Yeah, that part makes no sense. Because he, he kind of possesses, uh, uh...

Mike: 
Yeah.

Jay:
...what's-his-face. Janusz?

Mike:
Yeah, Janusz should really kidnapp the baby.

Rich: 
It was Janusz. Only he was a ghost for some reason.

Jay:
It was a ghost Janusz, which makes no sense.

Mike:
He looks like Janusz. The ghost looks like Janusz.

Jay:
Well, the ghost apparently is Janusz.

Mike:
Ugh...

Rich:
Dana even says it was Janusz. Some-, somehow, the ghost convinced the baby to climb out on the ledge before it got there.

Rich: 
Maybe, maybe Vigo killed the Janusz? And then after he kidnapped the baby, he, like, restarted his heart.

Jay:
Instead of just having Janusz, I mean, I guess it's for, like, ghost visual sake, but yeah, you could just have Janusz -- possessed Janusz -- show up and steal the baby.

Rich:
Show up with the gun.

Jay:
Show up with a gun. Sure.

Rich:
"I'm taking your baby now. What are you going to do?"

Jay:
Yeah. Maybe it was a case of, like, we haven't had a ghost for a while in the movie, so we have to have a scene with a ghost? I don't know.

Mike:
"Oscar!"

Jay:
This is funny. She says she's going to, he wants her to help her put down the baby. So, then he insults the baby. That's funny. How often in this movie is Bill Murray actually in the Ghostbusters uniform? 

Rich: 
He didn't want anything to do with this movie.

Jay:
Yeah, he's never in the costume.

Mike: 
I don't even think at the end. Yeah, he goes on a date. They go out for dinner...

Jay:
Yeah, I think yeah, I don't even think at the end of the movies, he's in the uniform.

Rich:
The very end, after they get out of the, um, asylum.

Jay:
Oh, the asylum.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
After they get out of the prison -- I mean, after they get out of the asylum.

Rich:
Right. Well, that's another parallel that's coming up.

Jay:
Yep.

Mike:
Oh, yeah.

Rich: 
I don't know if this scene has an equivalent.

Jay:
Where they're examining the painting?

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Um...ugh...no?

Rich:
Now, I'm assuming the museum didn't call them? They're just, they're just kind of barging in here.

Mike:
Well, yeah...the, they, the previous scene showed Egon making the connection between Vigo, right?

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah. So, then they just show up.

Mike:
Do they know the painting's there? I guess Sigourney Weaver...

Rich:
Yeah, they know the painting's there.

Jay:
Yeah, they know the painting's there.

Mike:
So, okay.

Rich:
But, theoretically, Janusz could just call the cops, and have them removed. They have no legal right to be in here--

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
--in the painting restoration area.

Mike:
Well, Bill Murray's--

Rich:
Yeah, I'm fine with it, just...

Mike:
--distracting him while they, because he keeps telling them to get out. So, yeah, they don't have a right to be there, probably. They're working undercover. They're the Ghostbusters, you know? The odds are against them.

Jay:
And, you know, f you're going to cut off the little side story with Ray getting possessed, why include this? Where he's, like, staring at the painting. Because that doesn't pay off in any way.

Mike:
Maybe just to--

Rich:
At the very end, it kind of vaguely does.

Mike:
Oh, yeah.

Jay:
Ehh, not r--

Mike: 
No, it does, it does. He takes over Ray's body at the end.

Jay:
He does, but--

Rich:
It, it, it...

Jay:
It doesn't.--

Rich:
It goes by so quick, though. It's like, why do it at all? 

Jay:
Yeah, exactly.

Mike:
Why do anything in this movie at all?

Jay:
I guess because you have to have something happened in the movie, especially at the end to make it seem like there's some sort of threat.

Mike:
Yeah. That's the only thing that happens that's some kind of interesting twist or anything.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Because, really, all they do is just--

Jay:
They just shoot at it with slime and proton packs.

Mike:
And then having him jump out of the painting into Ray's body at the last minute is some mild threat of some kind.

Jay:
That's immediately discarded.

Mike:
Yeah, but if, if, if they established, like, Vigo painting would, like, constantly possess people--

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
--and take over, it would have some sort of impact, but...okay, was this the room? Go, go...

Jay:
No, that shot didn't go on long enough for it to be the room. Yeah, I didn't really think about it. He spends this whole movie wearing this jacket. He's never in his costume.

Mike:
That's all right.

Jay:
It'd be all right if I knew it was, like, a character choice, and not just Bill Murray not wanting to wear the stupid costume anymore.

Mike: 
Well, Peter Venkman was never really a Ghostbuster.

Rich:
Well, he's...

Mke:
He was always just trying to con his way--

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--into, you know, along.

Jay:
Iit's funny at the end of the first movie when everyone's covered in marshmallow fluff--

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
--and he just has like a tiny bit on its shoulder.

Mike:
He's, he's not a uniform guy. The other two are.

Jay:
The other three. Winston is.

Rich:
Oh, yeah.

Jay:
He still is.

Mike:
Oh, sure. He's a uniform guy because he has to wear his uniform for work. And Ray and Egon are nerds.

Rich: 
They love what they do. They love being Ghostbusters.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
Yes. Peter Venkman does not.

Mike:
He's just out for himself.

Jay:
So, when they reboot Ghostbusters -- we talked about it a little bit -- but what other elements will be in, in the new Ghostbusters movie?

Mike: 
Flying Ghostbusters car.

Jay:
The car will fly?

Mike: 
Yeah. 

Rich: 
Are we assuming a sequel or a reboot?

Jay:
It'll be a reboot. Even if they have the, the, you know, even if Harold Ramis -- or, not Harold Ramis, oh, my god -- even if Dan Aykroyd shows up for, like, one scene, it's, he's still, it'll be one scene, and it'll be a wink, but he won't be a major part of the movie. 

Rich: 
Because I'm just wondering how they'll ruin, like, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

Jay:
Oh, oh. They won't do a direct remake of the first movie.

Rich:
They won't, it won't be that close?

Jay:
It will just be another movie with Ghostbusters, yeah. I don't think they would do that.

Mike:
No, not if they're including, uh, any of the originals.

Jay:
Even if they didn't include anyone from the first movie, I don't think they would just remake the first movie.

Mike:
Hmm.

Jay:
I think it would just be another movie with Ghostbusters.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
I don't know about the flying car, though, actually. I think that might be too futuristic.

Mike:
They would say it's too goofy. Definitely the, I don't know what model or make the car would be, but it would be a Ghostbusters car, but it would be sleek.

Rich: 
It wouldn't be an old junker.

Rich:
Would it be, like, a product placement car, though?

Jay:
Oh.

Rich:
It won't be, like, a funny car.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
It would be, like, like a Ford Explorer.

Jay:
Sure.

Mike: 
Sure. Probably. Probably.

Jay:
Something they got paid to use in the movie.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike: 
Yeah. And it would be eco-friendly.

Rich:
Sure. Sure. It would run on ectoplasm.

Jay:
In rewatching this movie, I didn't remember how little of the firehouse we actually see in this movie. They're not there very often in this one.

Mike: 
No, no. Oh, here's this subplot.

Jay:
Yep. "We have to put them in there because they were in the first movie. I guess we have to give them something to do."

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
But, yeah, she's got, like, the, the leopard print, you know, coat, the bright green gloves, and the bright red hair. Like, this is not the same person from the first movie. 

Rich: 
Ghostbusters one Janine would just be annoyed with Lewis Tully. "What's this asshole?" That's what she would say. "Get away from me!"

Jay:
Oh, Winston has something to do in the scene.

Mike:
Oh.

Jay:
He saves the day.

Mike: 
He comes in with a fire extinguisher. 

Jay:
Because Bill Murray doesn't care. So, he's not in half the movie. As something that he would do to, to Winston.

Rich:
Yep.

Mike: 
They're talking about what they want for dinner. I like that.

Rich:
Yeah, that's fine.

Mike:
Oooooooh.

Jay:
Now--

Mike:
Vigo did that.

Jay:
Vigo did that.

Mike:
He lives in pictures. No, he lives in images. That's his thing.

Jay:
Sure. I don't know. Just seems like they come up with vague ways to connect any sort of supernatural shenanigans. "He's in pictures, so then they're locked in the room! Oh, and they can just create ghosts out of slime!"

Mike: 
This is a mildly scary scene. 

Jay:
There's nothing -- no, this is okay. You at least feel like they're in some little bit of danger.

Rich:
But it doesn't end cleverly at all. Winston just busts in with the thing.

Jay:
Yeah. Yeah.

Mike: 
It's establishing the threat of Vigo...that he's there...or something.

Jay:
"Or something."

Mike:
I dunno.

Rich: 
It's not, it's not the worst scene in the movie. It's fine. It's a fine, it's a fine scene.

Mike:
I want to do the movie where I don't wear the costume--

Jay:
There's a number of scenes like this in the movie where the other three show up to tell Bill Murray something, and then he just leaves the scene.

Mike:
Yep.

Jay:
And they go off and do something else. 

Rich: 
Because it's probably the only way they could get Bill Murray to do it.

Jay:
I guess, yeah.

Rich:
Do you remember him saying, "I don't want to be covered in slime."

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
"I don't want to wear that heavy backpack."

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
He probably had a shit-ton of stipulations.

Jay:
Sure, sure.

Rich:
"I want to do as little as possible."

Jay:
But then I've heard him, like, in recent years, him complain about the, the lack of quality of the second Ghostbusters movie. You're like, "Well, you kind of contributed to that...by not wanting to do anything in it."

Rich:
Just shouldn't have done it at all.

Jay:
Yeah. I did like -- he was on Letterman a few years ago -- and Letterman mentioned, he's like, "Now you did Ghostbusters, and there was a Ghostbusters II..." And then Bill Murray just goes "Well, technically, yeah."

Rich: 
And there are people who hate him for not wanting to do the third one. I, I applaud him. 

Jay:
I don't blame him. He knows exactly what it'll be.

Rich: 
And, and this scnee doesn't work for me because Peter Venkman's not there.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
The chemistry is off without those three characters. 

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
I did like -- there was a moment here that kind of creeped me out as a kid, though, when they're yelling, and they hear the echo, and then Winston yells, and there's no echo.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
That, that kind of creeped me out. But then it's spoiled with the, the goofy demon voice yelling Winston.

Mike: 
And the ghost train. Don't forget about that.

Jay:
Because, yeah, trains have souls...I guess?

Mike:
It's a ghost. It's a ghost train.

Jay:
"It's a ghost train." There's nothing like that in the first one, right? It is ghosts of people, or interdimensional beings...

Mike:
No. The first one, is the first one when the Titanic comes back?

Rich:
That's this one.

Jay:
That is this one. Did you really ask that, if that happened in the first one? 

Mike: 
ugh...I did. I'm sorry.

Rich: 
That, that's something that could have happened -- there was a scene near the end when things were getting kooky. It could have happened in the first one, because that's, that's another scene that parallels.

Mike:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich: 
In the first one, it's that, that, like, I don't remember where at, but there's, like, a giant ghost in, like, a park or something.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
And that's kind of, like, the equivalent of the Titanic showing up.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Giant ghost in a park?

Rich:
It was, like, under some kind of arch or something.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
That's this one.

Rich:
Is that this one, too?

Jay:
That's thiis one too.

Rich:
Oh, okay. Oh, wow.

Mike: 
I think that's the first one.
 
Jay: 
No, you'll see it later.

Mike: 
It has, like, the big arms.

Rich:
Yeah!

Jay:
It shows up in this one. Trust me. I just rewatched this.

Rich: 
We'll see.

Mike:
All right, all right.

Rich:
Okay. I did too, though, so...

Jay:
That's sad. No, there's no inanimate object ghosts in the first movie.

Rich:
You know, if there was like a train derailment, and the, the train is a manifestation of, like, a whole bunch of souls, I'm okay with it.

Jay:
Okay.

Rich:
I'm okay with a ghost train.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
Ghosts are a thing.

Jay:
Hmm.

Mike:
People say they hear a ghost coming.

Rich: 
There's, you know, ghost ships.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
Ghost train's about the equivalent of a ghost ship. I'm okay with that.

Jay:
What does Dan Aykroyd think about these things, though?

Rich: 
He probably fully believes in them. 

Mike:
He would talk for two hours about it.

Jay:
"He would talk for two hours about it." Yeah.

Mike: 
And now the ghost train is really a UFO. That's too goofy. 

Jay:
This, this is kind of goofy. His face.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Winston is dead weight.

Jay:
Did he, I, I watched the kid, the cartoon all the time as a kid, but I don't remember much of it anymore. But did Winston had more to do in the cartoon? 

Rich: 
Yeah.

Jay:
Okay.

Rich:
I mean, they're all kind of, had equal screentime in the cartoon.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah. Did he have more of a character in the cartoon?

Mike:  
Not really. 

Rich:
No.

Jay:
He was still just the other, the other Ghostbuster guy?

Rich: 
He was the down-to-earth one.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
They treated him like an equal partner. I mean, they, really, he should just be the employee.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Right. He doesn't have a science-y background.

Jay:
Yeah, that would have been more interesting dynamic, if they kind of shit on him a little bit.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Like, not like, like, horrible assholes, but just treated him like a--

Rich:
"Go check that out!"

Jay:
Yeah, made him do all the grunt work. Like, that would have been a different angle.

Rich:
"Carry this."

Jay:
Yeah, they always make him carry the equipment.

Mike: 
Unbelievable is right.

Jay:
That's interesting, Rich, you saying that the slime was a toy sold before this movie existed.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
I did not know that, and it completely explains the existence of this movie.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich: 
I think they started selling in '87 or '88. But it was, it came out when the cartoon started coming out.

Jay:
Okay. When was Ecto Cooler introduced?

Rich: 
I'm going to say after this.

Jay:
After this? Well, the cartoon was still on after this.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
I just remember Ecto Cooler existed until, like, the early 2000's.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
I remember seeing it in the store. I was like, "Ecto Cooler is still around?"

Rich:
Might still be, I think they just changed the name.

Jay:
Okay.

Rich:
Eventually, they just lost the rights--

Mike:
No.

Rich:
--to Slimer.

Rich:
They just, they did? I thought it was, like, called like Shoutin' Orange Tangerine, or something weird.

Jay:
It was, yeah. It wasn't called Ecto Coole. But up until like 2000, 2001, it was still Ecto Cooler. 

Rich: 
Okay, okay.

Mike:
Back to the movie!

Jay:
Oh, talking about Ecto Cooler is more interesting than the movie at this point.

Mike:
That's true.

Jay:
Now, Sigourney Weaver, her character knows that this is a serious threat.

Rich:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
And she just doesn't care. She just wants to go out to dinner. Like, when they confront these to outside that apartment building to say, "We're going to go check out this river of slime, there's this big problem," like, she knows it's a problem, and she just wants to go have a nice dinner.

Mike:
But before, before the Gozer was in her icebox. And then she doesn't know at this point that, that, uh, Vigo wants her baby, right? So...

Jay:
No, I guess she doesn't know that.

Mike:
So, she doesn't give a flying crap about the river of slime.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
But, uh, she doesn't really care about anything in this movie.

Rich:
Okay. I'll buy that.

Jay:
That she doesn't care about anything in this movie? 

Mike: 
Her bathtub did try to attack her.

Jay:
Yeah. She knows, knows the slime of the threat. I don't think she knows specifically that Vigo wants her baby, but...

Rich: 
Did the slime try to grab her baby?

Jay:
It just, no, it grabs toward them.

Mike:
Well, yeah.

Rich:
Wasn't she worried about the baby, though, when she showed up at--

Mike: 
She was. She, so she didn't want to stay there anymore.

Jay:
But she's concerned about the safety of her baby, because there's slime monsters in her apartment. That makes sense. But she doesn't know specifically that Vigo is trying to take the baby.

Mike: 
Yeah, that Vigo is gonna possess her baby.

Rich:
You'd still think she'd want to be around her baby until this is cleared out for sure.

Mike:
Well, you know...you're right.

Rich:
Fancy dinners would be out of the question.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
But when you got Lewis Tully to watch your baby, then...they got nothing to worry about.

Rich:
Janine should not like this man at all.
Jay:
Oh, my god.

Rich:
This is so wrong.

Mike: 
They're married. It's because they have glasses.

Jay:
They're quirky. They're both quirky.

Rich:
I guess you liked Egon.

Jay:
Well, that made sense in the first movie.

Rich:
Egon's kind of nerdy.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike: 
"I'm usually very psychic about these things. I believe you're gonna die." Oh, God.

Jay:
What?

Mike:
Too soon?

Jay:
Oh...

Mike:
Has anyone, has anyone posted that clip online?

Jay:
I don't know, actually. 

Mike:
That's pretty awful. Sorry. I just, it--

Jay:
Rest in peace, Harold Ramis.

Mike:
I just thought of that scene. I liked that scene.

Jay:
Yeah. No, it's a good scene. I, I wouldn't have even made the connection if you hadn't said that the actor died. 

Mike:
Yeah, I didn't make the connection until I just said it. But that, that scene does exist in the first Ghostbusters movie. And she was right.

Jay:
Well, she'd be right if she said that to anybody.

Rich:
Mike, he, he lasted some 30 years after the prediction.

Mike:
But he, he was the first one to die from the Ghostbusters.

Jay:
Such a shame.

Jay:
That, that's actually something Jason Reitman said after Harold Ramis died that...I kind of didn't really think about, but he said for people of a certain age, Harold Ramis dying is like one of the Beatles dying. And it's true.

Mike:
Fancy dinner scene being interrupted, the equivalent of the Tavern on the Green scene.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Sort of.

Jay:
And these are all smart people. They're smart scientists. They're acting completely out of character here to be, like, freaking out and flipping, flipping slime everywhere. 

Mike:
They get excited. They get excited.

Rich:
Yeah, this, this doesn't bother me.

Jay:
But they're still, they're still rational people, like...

Mike:
Wasn't there--

Rich:
That, that Winston is there as weird. He should just be, "I want to go home now."

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich:
"I'd like my paycheck."

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
They really, really should have played up Winston just being a guy.

Rich:
It would have made him interesting.

Jay:
It would've, yeah. Other than him just being there for no reason.

Rich:
Yeah. Him being one of the group with not much of a personality does not work for me. 

Mike:
Him being in the sequel at all...

Rich:
Uh, yeah.

Mike:
...is, is, is unnecessary, from a character perspective,

Rich: 
But it would at least work if they played him up as an employee.

Mike:
Sure, sure. Or if there was a reason for him to have to work with the Ghostbusters.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
Contractually obligated, or a court order, or something.

Jay:
Oh, that would have been good, yeah.

Mike:
He doesn't want to be there. I don't know.

Rich:
"The last time I was with you guys, I almost got killed by a giant marshmallow!"

Mike:
Right.

Rich:
Make it a joke.

Jay:
Yeah.

Jessi:
Nobody is bothered by the fact that the three of them dress the same all the time.

Rich: 
Jessi. What the fuck are you doing here?

Mike: 
She just appeared!

Jay:
Weird. Are you a ghost? 

Jesse
I'm a ghost.

Jay:
Oh, no.

Jessi:
Sorry.

Mike: 
Yeah, why are they all wearing, like, long underwear now?

Jay:
That's what they wore under their outfits.

Mike:
Because, because firefighters do that, I guess, right?

Jay:
I don't know. Do they?

Mike:
It's sort of like a firehouse thing? Like, that was always the theme, sort of. Because cartoon show. Cartoon show logic.

Rich: 
Eh, whatever. Their underwear is not a problem.

Jay:
It's a minor problem. A very minor problem. Rich, did you ever see the, the revived Ghostbusters cartoon with the ethnically-diverse, uh, Ghostbusters?

Rich:
I, I have no fucking interest in the revived cartoon. Because it wasn't Peter Venkman.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Egon was on it, right?

Rich:
Egon Spangler -- well, he was there, but he wasn't...

Jay:
He was, like, their mentor. But there was, like, a kid in a wheelchair...

Rich:
Ray Stantz. Fuck that, and politically correct Ghostbusters bullshit.

Jay:
Wouldn't, when was--

Rich:
"We gotta have a multicultural Ghostbusters!"

Jay:
When was that on? When did that cartoon air? 

Rich: 
Ugh...probably in the mid-90's.

Jay:
Mid-90's? Okay.

Rich:
I mean, I guess. I don't know. I'm assuming.

Mike: 
Early-to-mid 90's.

Jay:
Well, not early, because the, the original cartoon would still be on.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Oh, here's where they meet with the mayor.

Mike: 
Just like they met with the mayor before.

Jay:
And the Walter Peck equivalent character is there.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
"Hey, remember, mayor, the time we save the city, and we're warning you that there's problems again, but you don't believe us for no reason?"

Rich:
"I'm actually kind of shocked it isn't Walter Peck for no reason.

Jay:
They figured that would be too much. That would be, that's the tipping of the scale. "If we put Walter Peck in it, people realise we're remaking the movie again."

Mike:
Mmm, the guys don't understand what they're talking about.

Jay:
The mayor, yeah, the mayor is just completely skeptical, even though all this has happened before.

Rich: 
"I don't believe in ghosts anymore!"

Jay:
I think there, there's some line in this where someone says that they'd, like, it was like, don't they make some, try and explain some reason why people would not believe them?

Rich:
Mass delusion.

Jay:
Mass delusion, or something like that. Like, one just completely stupid line. Bill Murray saying, "I'll be in the sequel. The scene where you guys are in your long underwear, find a way to not have me in that scene. I'll show up in a suit."

Mike:
"It's true. The man has no dick."

Jay:
Yeah, the -- the idea that there's some sort of, like, threat, like the slime or whatever it could be that that is feeding off the negativity of New York City, is an interesting idea...

Rich:
You'd have to show, like, New Yorkers being terrible to each other in order for it to work.

Jay:
Yeah. They don't, they don't establish any of that in this.

Mike: 
Yeah, there should be, like, horrible riots happening outside.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah. Early on in the movie, you show people being dicks to each other.

Mike: 
If that's your only concept, if the slime is just making people angry. But they have to throw ghosts in there on top of that.

Jay:
Right.

Mike;
So they can't do both. You can't have a Ghostbusters movie without ghosts.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
And then it would actually work at the end, when everyone starts cheering for, for New Year's Eve.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Yeah. But...

Jay:
Which is a corny ending in its own right, but if you're going to do something like that, you have to establish that everybody's being assholes to each other.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
It's like the new Robocop movie, where they don't establish that Detroit is a crime-ridden hellhole.

Mike:
Yeah, there's no, there's no evidence that the slime is doing anything negative.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Other than when they got covered in it. Bill Murray should just still be in his suit.

Jay:
"I'm not going to wear the straight jacket in this scene." Oh, and there's Brian Doyle Murray. He's Bill Murray's brother.

Mike:
Yep.

Jay:
Popping up for a little, uh, paycheck. I almost said cameo, but...

Rich:
Has, has he been in any movie that Bill Murray wasn't in? 

Jay:
Bryan Doyle Murray?

Rich:
Yeah

Jay:
Um, yeah. Yeah, he's been in stuff. He was in Cabin Boy, the Chris Elliott masterpiece. He was actually on the Chris Elliott show, Get a life, which, did you ever watch Get a Life?

Rich: 
Not really.

Jay:
The early episodes of that show were great.

Mike:
Oh, yeah. He was in Christmas Vacation, without Bill Murray.

Jay:
Yes, yes, it's true. He was the boss.

Rich:
Oh, yeah yeah.

Jay:
So, yeah, he's done stuff.

Mike:
"Bring me the child!"

Jay:
"Command me, my Lord!"

Mike:
Ugh.

Rich: 
Now he gets turned into a ghost somehow!

Jay:
Yeah, not a lot of humor in the second half of this movie, is there?

Mike:
No.

Rich:
It''s just a silly--

Jay:
It's a lot, it's a lot of ax-grinding, as they say.

Mike:
And these candles are absolutely necessary for their ritual.

Jay:
I'm okay with that. It adds atmosphere, or whatever.

Mike:
So there's no--

Jay:
"Out of this day of darkness..."

Mike:
"Wife to you...and mother to me." Yeah, maybe Vigo gives some magical powers to turn into a witch.

Jay:
But he's a ghost!

Rich:
He's transparent!

Jay:
Yeah, he's not just flying. He's a ghost.

Mike:
Magic power. He said, "Vigo was a powerful magician." That is a line in the film.

Rich: 
He clearly turns him into a ghost.

Jay:
That's, yeah, you can be a magician, but how do you make someone a ghost?

Mike: 
Magic. Ancient...

Jay:
Just magic?

Mike: 
...ancient Carpathian magic. I don't know. So why haven't they left?

Jay:
They're hanging out to keep her company. They have a line about it. 

Mike:
Oh, okay. Oh, and she wants to believe.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
They're just on a date.

Jay:
They think they're, they're doing something nice for her by keeping her company until Venkman comes home.

Mike:
The baby's not in the crib.

Jay:
But she doesn't want him there. They don't have a crib. She fled her apartment.

Mike:
Oh, that's right.

Rich:
Pay attention, Mike.

Mike:
Why wouldn't she hold her baby after she just got home from a long night out?

Rich: 
Maybe she just did. Maybe she was holding the baby for an hour. 

Jay:
Nah, she thinks the baby's sleeping. When she comes back, they, they have a line about it.

Mike:
Yeah. Okay. These are all fine.

Jay:
I just saw t,here's a little, uh, box of Hi-C on the table there, and I just had the thought that, what if they had put Ecto Cooler in the movie? Like, they put the Ghostbusters song in the movie, in the world of the movie. What if there was Ecto Cooler in this movie? I'm surprised they didn't do that.

Mike:
Ghostbusters have their own products. Oh my God, that little baby's on the edge.

Jay:
See, that's actually an angle you could take, though.

Rich:
But they wouldn't make a Slimer drink. They would have their own products, but they wouldn't make a Slimer drink.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah. They wouldn't make a Slimer drink, but the idea of them, like, like, creating all this merchandising and stuff, like, you can do something with that.

Rich:
They did save the world. I could see somebody writing a Ghostbusters song...that just happened to be the, the Ray Parker Jr. Ghostbusters song.

Jay:
So, yeah. Here's our ghost nanny Janusz, complete with ghost baby carriage.

Rich:
And a weird-ass outfit.

Jay:
Yeah. Well, he's supposed to be, like, a nanny. Nothing that's happening right now makes any sense.

Mike:
I always saw it as, like, yeah, I guess an evil nanny. It always reminded me of Wizard of Oz with the duhh-du-duh-duh-duhh-duh.

Jay:
Sure.

Rich: 
Flying around, it looks kind of like that.

Mike:
But she's riding a bike, right?

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
The witch is flying on a broom in that, right?

Rich:
Witch flying a broom, but the, earlier on, when they're still in Kansas...

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
...and the tornado is going on, it's a bike.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Yeah. She's just a mean old lady who becomes the witch in the dream.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
In real life, she just hates Toto.

Jay:
So, here's the equivalent of them-being-in-jail scene. Only this time, we're not getting any exposition. It's just a scene.

Rich: 
Though, this is a good joke, though, with, with, wiith Bill Murray saying, "These guys are crazy."

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Sure. Does the scene justify its existence by having that one joke, though? There's no purpose to this at this point. It's just a scene. 

Rich: 
Show that they're in the institution. I'm okay with the scene.

Jay:
Hmm. That's the great thing about the jail scene in the first one is, we get a lot of information.

Rich:
Yeah. 

Mike: 
Yeah, this is sort of information we've heard already.

Jay:
Yeah. It's just reiterating things we already know.

Mike: 
Oh, my god.

Jay:
So, even though Dana Barrett knows that there's a supernatural threat that has her baby that she probably cannot do anything about on her own, she doesn't bother to try and find the Ghostbusters. She just goes right to the museum. What does she plan on doing?

Mike:
She's, she's acting on instinct to save her baby, so...

Jay:
But what's she going to do?

Rich:
Well, you know, she--

Jay:
She knows people that hunt ghosts. Why doesn't she try and find them?

Rich:
She can't get a hold of them. They're in the mental asylum.

Jay:
But she doesn't know that.

Mike:
Maybe she tried to call 'em. And what did she--

Jay:
No, she didn't. She just fled the apartment. And went right there.

Mike:
Why do you hate? Why do you got to be a hater in Ghostbusters II?

Rich:
I'm just trying to find some logic in, in her actions.

Mike:
So...okay. Vigo wants a new body.

Rich:
Yes.

Jay:
Uh, even though he comes out of the painting at the end, so he has a body.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
Well, it's a ghost...body? He doesn't want a ghost body. He wants a baby body.

Mike:
Oh, that's right. They have to do this. I was like, what, why didn't he just go and fly a ghost out to grab a baby, like, like six days ago. But they have to do it some ritualistic New Year's Eve thing.

Jay:
Some, yeah. There's some explanation for it. 

Mike:
I forgot about that. I thought, okay, so...don't catch your coat on fire. Look out for those candles.

Rich:
Which is--

Jay:
Well, now--

Rich: 
No, go ahead. You go first.

Jay:
I was gonna say, now she's wearing Venkman's coat. Is that, like, a passing of the I-don't-want-to-be-in-this-movie-anymore baton?

Rich: 
Yes.

Jay:
"I'm done with this. I'm Ripley, dammit. Get me out of here!"

Rich:
She's got to kill time before the next Alien movie.

Jay:
Where did this, this would have been after Aliens, right?

Rich:
It would've been after Aliens. I'm not, probably before Alien 3.

Jay:
Before Alien 3.

Mike:
Oh, sure. Aliens was '86. Alien 3 was...'92? '93? '94?

Jay:
Early 90's, yeah.

Rich:
Sure.

Mike: 
So, yeah. In between the two Aliens. 

Jay:
That's disappointing. You win an Academy Award for playing an awesome character, and then you're just damsel in distress in a Ghostbusters sequel.

Rich:
Eh. You could do worse.

Jay:
And here's the, the--

Rich:
Oh, no! Slime!

Jay:
Yeah, this is the montage from the first movie of the ghosts taking over the city. 

Rich:
Now we'll see if that big ghost we're talking about shows up here.

Jay:
I can tell you that it does.

Rich:
But it hadn't during the day.

Jay:
No. It's during this sequence. This bit, I guess here with the coat, was something that was originally planned for the first movie.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
I like this a little bit. Then it scurries down the sidewalk. I like that.

Mike:
So, slime touching her shoes turned the mink into--
 
Jay:
As established earlier in the movie, the slime doesn't have to touch anything.

Rich:
Oh, my God! You're right.

Jay:
See, there it is. But this movie doesn't deal with inter-dimensional beings, so why is there a giant monster? In this movie, it's just ghosts.

Rich: 
Maybe that was a Tyrannosaurus Rex ghost, Jay. Dinosaurs have ghosts.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
They have souls, yeah. They're all in heaven with Jesus. What's so funny?

Jay:
Here's the famous Titanic sequence, with an odd Cheech Marin cameo.

Mike:
Yeah, I was gonna say, is that Cheech Marin.

Jay:
Like, if you're going to put a celebrity cameo, why would, you think you would aim higher than Cheech Marin. He wasn't even popular at that point.

Mike:
That, that hole on the Titanic's completely inaccurate, too.

Rich:
They found the Titanic by that point, too, so they knew what shape it was in.

Mike:
They didn't know, yeah, they knew, right, but they--

Jay:
Oh, look.

Mike:
--they didn't know about that part.

Jay:
It's Philip Baker Hall. He shows up for one line. And Ben Stein, who also shows up for one line.

Rich:
Everybody wants to be in Ghostbusters.

Jay:
These are, these are all people who have done stuff by this point. It's weird that, it's like Ben Stein was kind of famous from Ferris Bueller.

Rich:
He was never huge, though.

Jay:
Not huge, but--

Mike:
No.

Jay:
--he would show up, he would be That Guy in movies.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
And here, he's just like a background extra, almost. And Kurt Fuller still doesn't believe in ghosts, even though the city's run amok with ghosts.

Mike:
Yep. Yep. "You what? They're in jail? I mean, the hospital?"

Rich:
Mike, they changed it from jail to the hospital. That's something different, all right?

Mike: 
They're breaking new ground.

Jay:
I was gonna say, you actually see them leaving the psych ward in this, uh, which is different, but you do see them leaving the jail in the first movie, so...never mind. They get out. Do they get let out--

Rich:
The sky is even the same effect.

Jay:
Yeah. Yeah, they, they have a line, he says, "Have you ever seen anything like this before?" And I was thinking, yeah. In the first movie.

Mike:
Yeah. What does that have to do with the slime?

Jay:
Oh, look he put on the suit.

Rich:
It's the end of the movie.

Jay:
Way to be a team player, Bill Murray.

Rich:
More, more power to him. More power to him. 

Jay:
I, you know, yeah. He has some funny stuff in this movie. But I know he didn't want to do it, so the fact that you get anything out of him is, is impressive.

Rich:
He understood that the first movie did not need a sequel.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
He's, he's not interested in living in the past.

Rich:
And you can hate him for that, but he's right, and he's justified, and he doesn't owe you anything.

Jay:
Exactly. And look at where his career has gone compared to, to Dan Ackroyd's.

Rich:
I love Dan Aykroyd, I do. 

Jay:
Sure, but Blues Brothers 2000.

Rich: 
Yeah, I know, I know.

Jay:
Bill Murray's taking some chances. Tried some different things. Hasn't always been successful, but he's at least tried. I guess Dan Aykroyd tried. He made Nothing but Trouble.

Rich: 
You forgetting My Stepmother Was an Alien, Jay.

Jay:
Oh. Oh god, you're right. I am.

Mike: 
That's a classic.

Rich: 
That's a classic.

Rich:
Coneheads.

Jay:
Oh, Jesus. I actually, out of just random curiosity, recently rewashed Coneheads...

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
...there's no jokes in that movie. There are no actual jokes. That whole movie is just Dan Aykroyd does something weird.

Mike: 
And they eat Subway. 

Jay:
They eat Subway.

Jay:
Yeah, going back to what we were saying about, like, collaboration and stuff, the, like, comedies the generation of comedies and comedians after this era was so different. It was, like, everything was a vehicle. Like, there's the Jim Carrey vehicles. There's Adam Sandler vehicles.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Like, there's just that one funny person, or supposed to be funny person. It was less, less collaborative. And that's kind of come back around now, with, like, the Judd Apatow group, where it's more of a collaborative effort to be funny, and not just one person saying, "Look at me, I'm funny."

Rich: 
The, the video game is a better sequel.

Jay:
A better sequel than the non-existent Ghostbusters III?

Rich:
Than, than Ghostbusters II, and then the non-existent sequel.

Jay:
What is the story of the, the video game?

Rich:
They just follow up on Gozer stuff. But, I mean, the important thing, though, is you get those characters and you get the witty banter. The game was more quotable than Ghostbusters II.

Jay:
Oh, wow. 

Mike:
Hm.

Jay:
Does Bill Murray sound indifferent in his voiceover?

Rich:
Some people say he does. I, I think he sounds like Peter Venkman, though.

Jay:
Okay.

Rich:
He doesn't sound too different to me. But they give Egon, uh, uh, uh, one-liner at the end.

Jay:
Yeah?

Rich:
Yeah. He says, "We eat gods for breakfast."

Jay:
Oh, we're coming up on your favourite scene, Mike. 

Mike: 
What scenes's that? 

Jay:
Oh, you know what scene that is.

Mike:
Oh, god. You know, I, I don't, I, I tried to rewatch this movie a couple of times. I don't think I ever got this far. I don't think I, like, ever got to the Statue of Liberty part.

Jay:
Really? Like, since originally seeing it?

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Wow.

Mike:
I vaguely recall they had a Nintendo controller.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Um, and...yeah, it walks down the street.

Jay:
Yeah. This is, like, the movie is--

Mike:
Hold on. They, they use the torch to smash the..

Rich:
Well, this is, yeah, this is where I completely start hating the movie. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
With the Statue of Liberty.

Jay:
Most of the movie is a tired rehash. And then you get to this, and this is just dumb.

Rich:
It's also a rehash, though. They wanted a giant thing walking down the street. 

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Sure, sure. But, but this is just so stupid.

Mike:
Well, yeah. I thought the goodwill angle was people singing outside.

Rich:
It, it is.

Jay:
It is, yeah. You don't need the Statue of Liberty for that to happen.

Mike:
The Statue of Liberty was, like, brute force smashing it, but I guess the goodwill, uh, singing weakened the structure enough for the Statue of Liberty to hit it?

Rich:
Sure.

Mike:
This is just an excuse to use these things.

Rich: 
Well, they gotta sell toys, Mike.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
They got to make toys in there, so they can sell 'em.

Jay:
The slime has a different consistency here, too. It looks like silly string.

Mike:
Yeah. But can I just point out, too, that they only have four of these things that look like it holds maybe two gallons? Like, really?

Jay:
I, I could forgive that if I cared about any of what's happening in the scene. Oh, and there's the old Nintendo joystick.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
Here it is. Here is where the movie completely falls apart!

Mike:
So...what, they, they what? They...

Jay:
They, so they establish earlier, they play happy music and the toaster dances.

Mike:
I get, yeah.

Jay:
But, like, why, they play music here, but they still have to use some sort of Nintendo joystick to control it?

Rich:
Mm-hmm.

Mike:
Just so that it can show that they know, they could tell it where to go. They could direct, they could direct it.

Rich: 
Otherwise, it would just hop around randomly.

Mike:
Or, yah.

Jay:
But what is the Nintendo joystick hooked up to?

Mike:
It has a circuit board on it, Jay. Because science. Egon made it.

Jay:
"Egon made it."

Rich:
Why is it moving its legs?

Mike:
And why does--

Jay:
That's the thing. Nothing about this works.

Rich:
Shouldn't it just be hopping like the toaster did?

Mike:
I would be more okay if, if they used Vigo's magical psychic powers to somehow make the thing move, or, you know, use some sort of ghost logic, as opposed to the physical...

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
...uh, scientific explanation.

Jay:
Oh, they had leftover footage from that other scene, so they just threw it in there.

Rich:
I'd, I'd prefer they didn't do it at all.

Jay:
Well, yeah.

Mike:
Oh, god, yeah. Yeah, find some other, if they needed a big epic way to break into the Jell-O mold--

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
--they should have done something different. 

Rich: 
Was Louis in the cartoon? 

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich: 
He was in the cartoon.

Rich:
Only, only after this came out.

Jay:
Oh...

Rich:
He was in for, like, he was in, like, three episodes, because they tried to make the cartoon look a little bit more like Ghostbusters II.

Jay:
Hm.

Rich:
And then he never showed up again.

Jay:
Okay. Did he ever wear the Ghostbusters uniform? 

Rich: 
I don't recall. I know he's only in, like, a handful of episodes, though.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
Yeah. Okay. So why does the robe move? Why does the head look around?

Jay:
Nothing about this makes any sense.

Mike:
The torch actually doesn't shoot fire out, either. I don't think there's, like, propane and gas inside the torch in real life.

Jay:
Yeah, there's a lot of things, uh, with Ghostbusters, you have to suspend your disbelief to a certain extent, but this is just...

Mike:
And I also think the second the Statue of Liberty stepped on a street, it would collapse into it.

Rich:
Mm-hmm.

Mike:
Because it's not solid ground. It's, there's...

Jay:
It does crush a car.

Mike:
It does crush a car.

Rich: 
But it should be, like, breaking down into the sewer systems, and the subway systems.

Mike: 
It would just immediately collapse into the, into the ground, yeah. The weight of the Statue of Liberty, yeah. This is, this is, this is the worst film ever. It's, it's so illogical, so cartoony, so...

Rich:
Ugh...

Jay:
Yeah, I remember the cartoon making more sense than any of this.

Rich:
Typically, yes.

Jay:
The cartoon had little storylines, and...yeah, nothing this unbelievable for this universe.

Mike:
It just goes over the edge.

Jay:
And then Slimer shows up again, because Slimer.

Mike:
Oh, he's the bus driver. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike: 
Well, that makes sense that they had their little interplay that you mentioned, Rich.

Rich:
Yeah.

Jay:
Though, with that cut out, like...

Rich:
It's just completely fucking random.

Jay:
It's just random, yeah.

Mike:
He does run into him in the montage sequence, and runs away, but...

Jay:
At least they didn't put Slimer in this more. Because I know the cartoon, he lived at the firehouse. And he was like a regular character.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
I think he even had his own cartoon, right, for a while?

Rich:
Yep. That's when the cartoon started to get bad. The first few, the first two seasons are pretty dark.

Jay:
Hm.

Rich:
And then they decided it had to be all kid-friendly.

Mike:
Oh...

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
So, I see that the, the goodwill singing opened up a window right by the glass dome. Did you just see that?

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
It started to clear away.

Jay:
Well, they're not singing yet. People are cheering, and they're happy to see the Statue of Liberty but the singing comes a little bit later.

Rich:
The statue itself apparently has enough goodwill...

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
...I guess?

Jay:
That, that gives them a little bit of goodwill. And then they start singing, and that's what really defeats Vigo. 

Rich: 
The Ghostbusters are really, you know, Vigo's plan is inherently flawed, isn't it? Because the Ghostbusters don't defeat Vigo. The singing does. 

Jay:
Well, the singing weakens him, and then they shoot at him.

Mike:
They shoot him with their guns.

Jay:
And then they shoot at him, and that's it.

Rich: 
But it makes them flee back into the painting, right?

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
I mean, his whole thing is, he'll have enough power, and he could do it then.

Mike:
Here's, here's another parallelization, that the Louis Tully covered in some kind of slime.

Jay:
Oh, covered in something, yeah.

Mike:
And or disoriented. Little baby...that's positively charged.

Jay:
We gotta explain it somehow. Just throw a line in. They can control whether the slime is positive or negative now?

Rich:
They, they establish that earlier. It's when Egon made love to it.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Rich: 
It was that scene, they explained this.

Jay:
So, do you think all these tanks of slime here, Egon had to fuck all those, and that's how they made it all positive?

Rich: 
That's why it looks different. It's both slime and semen. 

Jay:
Okay. That makes sense.

Mike:
Oh...

Jay:
There's a deleted scene of Egon just, just fucking those tanks.

Mike:
Isn't there a different area in the place you can hide the baby? It's like a gigantic museum.

Jay:
Yeah, go into the bathroom or something. And then he just appears. 

Rich: 
He doesn't need a baby!

Mike: 
No, he's out of sync with reality.

Jay:
I don't know how this actor didn't go on to a huge career after this movie. He's such a, such a looker. He could be the next Brad Pitt.

Rich:
It's not even his voice.

Jay:
"It's not even his voice." I actually did see that guy in one other movie. He's in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness. He shows up and blows his head off with a shotgun. 

Rich: 
Does he say anything?

Jay:
He does. He has a couple lines.

Mike:
Here, this is when they got knocked down by, uh, Gozer.

Jay:
Yeah. That's just because they didn't want to act anymore. They were like, "Can we just lay here for the rest of this scene?"

Mike:
This is exactly what happened. Except they're not on the edge of a building.

Jay:
Right. But they don't even bother to get up for the rest of the scene. They're just gonna lay there.

Rich:
Do you remember in the first one when Egon said, "I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought"?

Jay:
I love that line.

Rich:
He kind of looks like Dolph Lundgren here. Or, not Dolph Lundgren. Who am I thinking of? Highlander. Uh...

Mike:
Oh.

Jay:
What's that guy's name?

Mike:
Christoipher...

Jay:
Lambert.

Mike:
Lambert.

Jay:
Lambert.

Mike: 
Not so fast, Vigo.

Jay:
See, Bill Murray doesn't want to get up. He's done with this movie. Can I nap until we're done with the scene?

Mike: 
They could aim their weapons at him, right?

Rich: 
Well, they might hit the baby.

Jay:
Yeah, he is holding the baby.

Mike:
Well, before that.

Rich:
I guess they could shoot the baby with the slime cannon. It wouldn't...

Mike:
Yeah, it's positively charged.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
You don't want Vigo to drop the baby, though.

Jay:
No, no.

Mike: 
They were weighing all these possibilities. And Sigourney Weaver is tied up with plastic tubes.

Rich: 
Dropping the baby is better than Vigo overriding the baby soul, okay?

Jay:
That shot of Egon. Nobody cares anymore.

Rich:
'How do end this movie?"

Mike: 
Oh, no. This is when he hears the singing.

Jay:
This is, the singing now is weakening him. 

Rich: 
You need to establish that everyone in New York is a jackass.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
I think they're going on the assumption that everyone knows that already.

Jay:
Yeah, I know. But for the sake of the film...

Jay:
Yeah, well, that's like I mentioned, the new Robocop, like, we know that Detroit sucks, but in the movie, you have to establish that.

Mike:
Here's kind of a funny payoff when he inadvertently blasts off the thing.

Jay:
He, he thinks what he did helps.

Rich: 
I hate it.

Jay:
"I hate it."

Mike: 
It's something. It's...

Jay:
You could just not have him in it at all. Lewis Tully has no purpose to be in this movie.

Rich:
Exactly.

Mike:
It's, you can almost have not, not have anything in this movie. Once you take one thing out, you take the other thing out, then the other thing, and the whole thing falls apart.

Jay:
Sure.

Rich:
Well, this movie should not have been made.

Mike: 
Someone made a whole bunch of money off this, Rich.

Jay:
This was a hit, right?

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Like, I don't think anybody really remembers it fondly, but it did make a shitload of money.

Rich:
You go to see just because it says Ghostbusters.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah. I do like this makeup on him here.

Mike: 
Yeah, the demon character looks cool.

Rich:
Here's, here's the big Ray-possession payoff. For one second.

Jay:
He gets posssesed for one second, and then that's it.

Rich:
Harold Ramis has a great line.

Jay:
"We'd like to shoot the monster." Yeah, that makeup's great.

Mike:
Although, Winston's reaction was really good there. Mild fear.

Jay:
So, they're shooting him with positively charged slime, and they're shooting the painting with the, the proton packs. What is this, what is this doing?

Rich: 
It defeats evil, Jay.

Jay:
That's not even what proton packs do.

Rich:
You can, you can clearly see -- I know.

Jay:
They're like lassos, basically.

Rich:
I know.

Jay:
Lassos for ghosts.

Mike:
Mm-hmm.

Rich:
I mean, they could have come up with something clever. You know, like, they could, they could have thrown, like, turpentine on the painting.

Jay:
Oh!

Rich:
And that could have defeated Vigo.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
And that would have been mildly clever.

Mike: 
But that wouldn't involve them shooting their proton packs.

Jay:
Yeah, you have to, you have to have them shooting the proton packs, even if it doesn't make any sense. Just because they're Ghostbusters, and that's what they do.

Rich: 
Like, destroying that painting, that's, like, the obvious thing.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Now just shoot it. 

Jay:
"Just shoot it."

Rich:
It is the laziest fucking way they could have ended this movie. And that's what, that's what they went with. Ray doesn't even get to do anything, but be on the floor, out of commission. I like Ray, dammit.

Mike:
"Who does your taxes?"

Rich:
Oh, that was a fun line. I wish this movie had fun lines. 

Jay:
It has some early on.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike: 
Oh, don't they ask him for a piece of his brain, or was that the first one?

Rich:
That's the first one.

Mike:
Yeah, I'm sorry. Was going up, holding out for hope that there was a fun line in this movie.

Jay:
Now Ray is covered, they're both covered with the positively-charged slime, so they just say they love each other, even though he doesn't, they don't know each other.

Mike:
Well, it's being drunk or whatever. He's, he's, he's high on happiness.

Jay:
Whatever. And then this doesn't make any sense. I know it's supposed to be just, like, an end gag, but it's stupid. 

Mike:
Oh, this is beyond stupid. It's into cartoony realm.

Jay:
It's a fun painting by itself. It's amusing looking, but, yeah, why, this doesn't make any sense. 

Rich: 
Did Vigo paint that before he died?

Mike: 
It's just a wink-wink joke.

Rich:
I know.

Mike:
Iit's not meant to make any sense. And then they all climb down the stairs of a building.

Jay:
And the credits roll as everybody cheers.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Come on, guys. 

Mike: 
Yeah. "We're going to be in the Ghostbusters sequel, isn't this great?" No.

Rich: 
And it's over.

Jay:
Then we get our roll call credits?

Mike: 
Yeah. Were there any, like, cutscenes from this? I don't remember him opening the fridge.

Jay:
Some, some of this stuff is footage that wasn't in the rest of the movie. And then it cuts to, uh the scene you were talking about, Rich, that shows a little bit of that.

Rich: 
Oh, we have the Statue of Liberty? 

Jay:
Yeah. Yeah, like this wasn't in the movie. I miss Rick Moranis.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
God bless him, though, for leaving Hollywood because he just didn't care to do movies anymore.

Rich:
Jay, he owes you more entertainment. He owes you! 

Mike:
This is not in the movie.

Jay:
That's not in the movie.

Rich:
They never wear those new uniforms outside of the montage, do they? 

Jay:
Um, I think...

Mike:
Why is he there?

Jay:
"Why is he there?"

Jay:
This is, like, wrapping up his little subplot, but they didn't care, so they just cut it out of the movie. Not that it was a subplot, but making him become a more positive character.

Mike:
Some of these shots, I'm, I'm assuming they shot for the...

Rich:
There's, there's another scene where they talk to the mayor before they go into the museum. 

Jay:
Another scene where they talk to the mayor?

Rich:
Yeah. Before they go to the museum, it's another cutscene.

Jay:
Oh...like outside the museum? 

Rich: 
Yeah. 

Jay:
Okay. What do they talk to him about? 

Rich: 
I don't, I haven't seen it. But I know it existed at some point.

Jay:
Okay.

Rich:
Those, those grey uniforms were, like, on the poster, and they never wear them.

Mike:
Oh, look. They're getting a key to the city.

Jay:
Is that just an excuse to have more toys?

Rich: 
I don't think they ever made--

Jay:
Different outfits?

Rich:
--I don't think they ever made toys like that.

Jay:
No? They made some weird-ass Ghostbusters toys, especially near the end.

Rich:
Sure.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
I remember there were ones that, I had, like, a Ray one where you squeeze his arm and, like, the top of his head pops up, and his eyes stick out. Like, they were coming up with weird toys. 

Rich: 
Did, did, did any kids ever want those? Because the only ones I ever wanted were just the standard uniform Ghostbusters with proton packs.

Mike: 
I agree. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah, that's the, I don't even remember, I think I must have got it as a present or something, because I didn't have any of the weird ones. I didn't have very many Ghostbusters toys, in general. I had a shitload of Ninja Turtle toys. I had the proton pack. That's all I wanted.

Mike: 
I had the, the regular toys, and the car.

Jay:
Did either of you ever have the, the firehouse? 

Rich: 
Yeah.

Mike: 
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah?

Mike:
I think I had the firehouse

Jay:
You both had the firehouse? 

Mike:
Yeah. I think so. Or a friend of mine had it.

Rich: 
I, I definitely did.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
I had that, and I had the Ecto-1.

Jay:
Mm.

Mike: 
Yeah. Ecto-1. The Ecto-1 did not fit in the firehouse, though?

Jay:
No.

Rich: 
It fit through the doors, but, like, the back end would be, like, sitting way out behind the playset...

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
...I think. I could be misremembering. 

Jay:
Was the firehouse like Castle Grayskull, where it, like, hinges open? 

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Okay.

Mike:
It would close. Yeah, I didn't have the firehouse. I remember, like, a friend did.

Rich: 
I, I remember it had an action pole that the Ghostbuster would slide down.

Mike:
They had a pole.

Rich:
On a little platform, and it was, like, spiraled, it would spin.

Mike:
Uh-huh.

Jay:
I never had any of these things. All I had was Ray. When you squeezed his arm, his eyes popped out. 

Mike: 
Jay had a part of a slinky.

Jay:
"I had a part of a slinky."

Rich:
The end.

Jay:
That's, that's Ghostbusters II.

Mike:
Yep.

Jay:
Why do people want Ghostbusters III? 

Rich: 
I mean, this movie is proof. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Evidence that it should never happen. 

Jay:
Light, lightning in a bottle, that first movie.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
You can say that the concept works in different realms, but it really, it, it was so many specific decisions made by these specific people that made that movie what it is. 

Mike:
Is this a lot, a lot of, a lot of people not getting it...you know?

Rich: 
See, I don't know if this is terrible as much as it is just a letdown. It was definitely not good. 

Jay:
Yeah. 

Mike: 
Oh, right. 

Rich: 
You could do worse. 

Jay:
Oh, there's been plenty of worse sequels, but...I don't know. This is almost worse in the sense that it's so uninspired. That's, like, like, when something is that middle-of-the-road, it's almost worse than, like, a complete disaster of a sequel, because that's at least interesting in a certain way.
