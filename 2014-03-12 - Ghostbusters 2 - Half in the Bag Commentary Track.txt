Jay:
Hello, and welcome to the half in the bag commentary track for Ghostbusterâ€™s Peace Sign. I'm Jay.

Mike:
And I'm Mike. 

Rich:
And I am the Keymaster. 

Jay:
Oh.

Mike:
Oh. That was just a big failure right off the bat.

Jay:
Just like Ghostbusters II.

Mike: 
Yes.

Jay:
Um, well, I guess, we should say right off the bat, rest in peace, Harold Ramis.

Mike:
Yes, of course.

Jay:
And we're talking about one of his, his lesser works, but I think we all still, uh, loved and admired a lot of things that Harold Ramis did, so... 

Mike:
Ghostbusters II is not one of them. Although he has his moments in this. 

Jay:
Egon's the best part of this movie. He has the best, uh, the best bits.

Mike:
But this is a terrible, terrible film.

Jay:
Would you call it a terrible film?

Mike:
Mmm, I know...

Jay:
It's the embodiment of how not to make a sequel. It's the exact same movie, uh, almost scene for scene. You can, you can look at scenes in this movie and pinpoint exactly the equivalent of that scene to the original.

Mike:
Yeah, exactly. All the plot points are identical. 

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
Who, who outside of Dan Ackroyd and the studio wanted to make this movie?

Mike:
Uh...

Rich:
We know Bill Murray doesn't want anything else to do with the franchise. And I don't blame the man.

Mike:
Anyone who invested money into it. Wanted to make it too.

Jay:
And because audiences wanted it. 

Rich:
For sure. I mean, this is the movie they had to made the movie they necessarily wanted to make. 

Jay:
Yeah, it's interesting, because clearly, they had more money to work with the first movie made so much money. You would think like, especially with all the weird ideas Dan Aykroyd had before you know, the first movie got pared down to what it was for budgetary reasons. Like, you can take the Ghostbusters in so many different directions. Why have them repeat the exact same thing?

Mike:
These are all very good questions.

Jay:
We may never know the answer to them either.
Mike:'t one there is nobody involved with the movie cares enough to do a commentary. There are no special features of any sort for any release of Ghostbusters two.

Mike:
we got to remember to point out all the equivalency scenes. Yes, it was of course the old lady in the basement of the Public Library seen the opening, it's the opening tag, which most movies have the you know, the opening scene of a movie kicks it off.

Jay:
But actually, like the scene. I don't know. Why don't you like the scene?

Mike::
Because it's stupid.

Jay:
Do you elaborate?

Mike
It's dumb, some slime gun on the wheel of her carriage and moved it around to the point where they dig in the street later for no reason, which appeared to be a random spot above the river of slime for absolutely no reason. So, it was clearly a very terrible way to shoehorn in Sigourney Weaver's character for no reason whatsoever. 
Mike:
Jay:
Well, that's huge evidence that she's right in the heart of the threat of this movie.

Mike:
Because her baby carriage rolled over a random patch of slime that somehow got all the way up the street level. Even though later in the movie, it's clearly running in a river 700 feet below the street.

Rich:
And it's just randomly Dana Barrett. Yeah, it's not like it had to be Dana Barrett because it goes over it. 

jay
Or no everything in this movie happens so they can have it be the exact same things the first one.

Mike:
Other than the cube baby, the opening sequence is completely stupid.
Mike:
 This is the only good music in this movie. 

Jay:
Is it weird that the Ghostbusters theme song is now in the Ghostbusters universe? 

Mike::
Yes. I always thought that was odd. That's also weird that they changed their logo too. 

Jay:
That makes no sense completely. 

Mike
I don't know if that's considered breaking the fourth wall or what.

Jay:
I guess it would be their company though is not a sequel. 

MikeMike:
No. 

Jay:
They're just reopening their company. 

Rich:
It's stupid. I don't think anybody likes that logo. 

Jay:
No, no.

Mike:
When they update the car for the seat. and they have like. 

Rich:
No, it's not like Ecto two it's Ecto one. a lot of things in this movie are done for the sake of like the cartoon that was going on at this time. Like the cartoon had an Ecto two helicopter, so they couldn't call the actor one in this the actor two they had to call the One A.

Jay:
Oh, that is interesting. Yeah, that was well let me ask Do you guys remember seeing this movie for the first time? Do you remember what your reactions were when you first saw it? 

Rich:
I hate it. Why I remember hating the slime plant. I thought that was just retarded. Yeah. And just in general being led down after the first act. I love the first part. You see where like where they are now? 

Jay:
well, this That's what's interesting is like I like seeing where they are now but this would have been more interesting scene where they weren't if this was like a sequel made now, likeMike: right at this is only a couple years after the first one, it's done that the Ghostbusters are broke up and they have to get back together because just for the purposes of recreating the first movie again, like if this was like, Egon, you know, they're all retired from Ghostbusters. Now he's in the 60s, he's doing these weird experiments. Ray runs in a cult bookshop, like all that stuff would have been interesting if they were older. Right? But having happened right after the first movie is the lame way to just write the same script again. 

Rich:
Yeah, but this is one of my favourite scenes in both movies. 

Jay:Mike:
Yeah, I would agree here. I like this. Let's see what happens when we take away the puppy. Oh, yeah, all the that's the interesting thing about this movie. The script is incredibly stale, but there's lots of good bits in it. There's lots of funny moments.

Mike:
Yeah, mostly in the first act like Rich said love funny moments. But point for point. It's the exact same story like which it's just so frustrating. As you said they could have taken it in so many different directions. 

Rich:
ironically, the movie becomes stale. The moment they become Ghostbusters again. Which is evidence in my mind that they should never make Ghostbusters three. I mean, they really can't now.

Mike:
they'll remake Ghostbusters.

Jay:
That's the thing, there's in the wake of Harold Ramis his death, like the day after he died. Everybody was like we're still making Ghostbuster Three, like fuck you, assholes get you wait a month or so before jumping all over it.

Mike:
But I think it called three or?

Jay:
I think even if because there's been talk for so long that it'll be like passing the baton movie to these younger comedians or whatever. And the original members will have one or two scenes. But I think even if that is the case, they will not call it Ghostbusters three. They'll just call it Ghostbusters. 

Rich:
75% of what makes the first movie good, is the interaction between Dan Ackroyd Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. you can't pass the torch. It's just something different at that point. Mike:

Jay:
I think a lot of people would argue that it's like the Ghostbusters concept is what could keep it going without these actors. But I disagree with the reason that movie works like the movie is those characters. 

Rich:
It's half the equation about that. 

Jay:
More than that. 

Mike:
So, the first Ghostbusters movie is a fluke. 
Mike:
Jay:
It's lightning in a bottle. 

Mike:
Yeah, it was accidental almost. 

Jay:Mike:
Well, you hear about Dan Aykroyd 's original idea. And it was like this huge thing. And, that's going back to Harold Ramis. One of the things I like about him and this era of comedians, was such a collaborative effort. It was all these different people that are funny people contributing ideas and shaping it into what it ended up being. And that was true of a lot of the comedy at that time that all these guys were involved with.

Mike:
Yeah, and there are a couple of jokes in the first Ghostbusters that fall flat. And you could kind of see like, there's a couple of Peter Venkman bits that I was like, what you know.

Jay:
How would you say that about?

Mike:
Well, I'll get into it later but it seems like a couple of different approaches all that happened to work together on. Because, you see Bill Murray doing does his comedy stuff. It's inappropriate. And it's like, you get this idea like isn't it funny if there were like these blue-collar exterminator guys that that got rid of ghosts instead of pests and there's Apple angle? but that's a whole another = comedy movie. And it's like and then you have these serious plots about the interdimensional God that's trying to come to earth and all this stuff. And then the technology stuff like all those elements all melded together perfectly where could have been just as horrible disaster. Like the second one.

Jay:
Well, the second one is okay, the first one worked we don't want to take any risks. We're just going to make the same movie again. Yeah, just play it as same as possible.

Mike:
And those the thing with the first one is just it was just risks all over the place, everything. 

Jay:
that's what you wonder like the people that are still interested in seeing a Ghostbusters three, like they forget about Ghostbusters two. 

Rich
They don't understand why the first one works. Maybe they just want to see proton packs shooting and ghosts. That's all they really want. 

Jay:
I say if you want to see Ghostbusters three to look at examples of why that shouldn't be made. Look at one Ghostbusters two. And then look at Blues Brothers 2000. Like, just let it go. Just let it go. The most depressing thing about Blues Brothers 2000, is the very beginning before the movie starts. There's a title screen that says in memory of John Belushi, John Candy and Cab Calloway. Like the three most interesting aspects of that movie, they're all dead and we're gonna make the movie Anyway, and I fear if a Ghostbusters three happens, they'll say in memory of Harold Ramos, like, Oh, poor Harold Ramos.

Mike:
But I think the reason why this first act works is because it plays up those these three characters and they're there. They're sloppiness, they're awkwardness. They're like Bill Murray is a con man. He's doing his con man bit yeah Egan's a bizarre scientist who's out of touch with normal people. and raised in love with the occult and bookstore. He's obsessed with his craft and what he does. 

Rich
And nobody gives a fuck about Winston, so they don't really show what he's doing.

Jay:
They give him one scene early on, so you remember him. And then he disappears.

Mike:
Winston, Winston was just a gag in the first one, essentially.

Rich:
He's, I think he's in this, see, I think he's in this because of the cartoon.

Mike:
Yeah, sure.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich:
Winston does not need to be in this movie.

Jay:
He served a very specific purpose in the first movie.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: Which was to explain how all this science works-

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: --to the audience. He is the every guy. He has no real character, other than that. He's just a guy. Um, now we know how all this stuff works, and he's completely unnecessary

Rich: And the jokes over.
 
Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
I don't know. I think Winston's presence in the first one was some kind of bizarre, dated joke, like...

Jay:
Mmm.

Mike: Like, I think it was just sort of, like, they hired an extra guy, just, just--

Rich
It's funny that they just have this guy who is uninvolved.

Mike:
Yeah.

Rich:
He's just a guy that they hired.

Jay:
He's just there for a pay check, yeah.

Rich:
And he's just with them.

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich: That in itself is kind of funny.

Mike:
He's just some guy that got hired to help, and he knows nothing about what's going on.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah, but he works as explaining, like, they explain to him how the containment unit works, and all that. So, he has a story function as well. 

Mike:
You could use Peter Venkman's character in that regard, too, though.

Jay:
I suppose., I suppose.

Mike:
Like, Egon could explain to him what's going on, but...

Rich:
In this movie, he serves absolutely no purpose.

Mike:
That's true. A lot of things don't serve a purpose in this movie.

Jay:
I do like Janosz. He's a nice new addition, because he's something different, even though he serves the same story function as Rick Moranis in the first movie.

Mike:
Right.

Jay:
He's, he's weird, and I like him. He has some good lines. I think one of my favourite lines in this movie is when he -- it just happened -- where he says, "Everything you're doing is wrong. I want you to know this."

Mike:
I, I really like when, um, Venkman asks him, he's like, "Where's that accent from? Where are you from?" He's like, "The Upper West Side."

Jay:
Yeah, he's something different for this movie, when everything is so...

Rich:
They rip that off from Short Circuit.

Jay:
Oh, really?

Rich:
"Where are you from?" "Pittsburgh."

Mike:
Oh, really? 

Jay:
Oh...

Mike:
Oh, so, the Indian character.

Rich:
Yep.

Mike:
Well, damn you, Bill Murray.

Jay:
Bill Murray?

Mike:
Or, saying that that's an ad lib.

Jay:
No, he says the Upper West Side.

Mike:
Well, I know, but the joke, the joke...

Jay:
Oh, oh. Okay. Here's Vigo. Not quite as interesting a villain.

Rich:
He's such a letdown when he walks out of the painting.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
They should have had him walk out all majestically, and then trip and fall.

Jay:
No, I like that the villains in these movies are treated seriously .

Mike:
Of course.

Jay:
Like, even when he sayin his, like, "From the--", what is his big speech in this?

Mike:
Yeah, yeah.

Jay:
It's so goofy, but he plays it so straight, and it works.

Mike:
But unfortunately, he does nothing in the film.

Jay:
He does nothing in the movie, and he's -- the ending is horribly anticlimactic when they just kind of shoot him, and then that's the end of the movie. We'll get to that, yeah.

Rich:
Well, they didn't know what to do -- they didn't know how to end the first one either. I mean, I, as classic as "crossing the streams" is, it does feel tacked on.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
A little bit, yeah.

Mike:
That they're--

The movie's won, uh, you over by that point, so it almost doesn't matter.

Rich:
Yeah.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
Yeah, all this stuff where they're not Ghostbusters is wonderful. It's so bizarre. It's very appropriate to the characters.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah.

Rich:
And the characters is why the concept works, more so than the ghost packs--

Jay:
Yeah.

Rich:
--and the technology.

Jay:
And that's why, when people say like, "Oh, you could just have a new series of comedians. It's the concept", that's...I don't, it really isn't the concept. The concept's neat, but it's really these guys--

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
--and the way they, they handle all that stuff that sells it.

Mike:
Yeah. But we all know when they make a new Ghostbusters it'll be proton packs firing every two seconds.

Jay:
Yeah...

Rich:
They're going to look like iPods on their back, too.

Mike:
Yeah, good call.

Rich:
MM-hmm.

Mike:
Good call. They want it -- there, they'll be sleek, and black.

Rich:
Mm-hmm.

Jay:
It'll be like the Robocop remake. It'll start like looking like this. And they'll say, "We got to upgrade!"

Mike:
Right. Oh, will the Ghostbusters car be, be something new now?  

Jay:
Mm.

Rich:
It'll have to be, yeah. Because they will have to change everything for no good reason. 

Jay:
Yeah. Well, speaking of things they'd update, this is, I didn't realise until recently: the first Ghostbusters, uh, Sigourney Weaver was, like, 36 when they made that movie. And the equivalent of her character -- if they made this now, as no studio would cast the 36-year-old actress -- it would be someone like late 20's, maybe 30 at the most.

Mike:
How old is Bill Murray here? 48?

Jay:
I know Harold Ramis was 40 when they made the first movie.

Mike:
Yeah.

Jay:
And that's the same thing. Like, yeah, these guys are all too old. You can't have them as the leads in your movie.

Mike:
Right. But it's believable.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike: Because they're older dudes that work in, uh, a university.

Jay:
Mm-hmm.

Mike:
As frauds.

Rich:
The fact that they're schlubs is part of just what makes it work right.

Mike:
Calm man. Scientist in the flow. 

Jay:
Back off scientistâ€™s man. So, that's another thing. They broke up. Bill Murray and skinny Weaver broke up after the first movie so they could have a romance blossom in this once again. The only difference is that she has a kid.

Mike:
So, this scene of course, is the equivalent of the Bill Murray comes into our apartment the first-time scene. And makes awkward advances on her and pokes around with a little stick thing, exact same movie.

Jay:
This scene does feature my favourite he online though in either of the movies. I had part of a slinky I straightened it this just trying to imagine the backstory of how he ended up with part of a slinky. Where's the rest of it? Yeah, you guys got the best stuff in this movie?

Mike:
Yeah, they chose not to say I had a slinky. But I straightened it. 

Rich:
And make sure it makes your brain work trying to fill it. 

Jay:
So, let's movie came out in 1989. That was a big great movie.

Mike:
It was Franklin has to get the stool sample, which is exactly the same as Venkman having to scoop up the slime off. Let's point out our complete parallelization. Yes, well, you're saying J summer of 89. Movie summer ever.

Jay:
It's like Back to the Future to the excellent adventure was that let's say Batman. Dick Tracy. I don't know what it was 89 was it? That was the year after because they ate like the Batman. Yeah, that might have been 90. But the most important movie of 1989 that came out. was UHF. Yes. That was 89. That's why it flopped because it came out against Ghostbusters to the future to all these big movies. But I probably rewatched UHF more as a kid than any of those other movies. Except for maybe Batman. I watched the shit out of Batman.

Mike:
And I have seen Batman in a while.

Jay:
Yeah, I remember seeing this. This may be my first like, cinematic disappointment seeing this in the theatre as a kid, where even as a kid I was like, this is the same movie. Like when I was old enough to understand things like that. 

Rich:
I just understood that it bored me. 

Jay:
I was actually because I was a big fan of the cartoon. I did like the cartoon a lot. But I was disappointed that the movie was doing things similar to the cartoon. I was like, I wanted to see a sequel to the movie. I don't want to see the cartoon. In the theatre friend friendly. Slimer Janine has a completely different character. Now she's spunky and has bright red hair. And it looks just like she does in the cartoon. The giant glasses. And the first movie, she's just a board receptionist. And they set up a budding romance between her and Egon, and they ignore that. And this one. Yeah, for some reason. 

Rich:
They hook her up with Lewis Tolley? 

Jay:
For no reason other than they wanted to put Louis in the movie. 

Jay:
There's a whole subplot cut out with Louis Tolian Slimer there Oh, there was more to that there was Lewis tele has like three scenes where he's trying to catch Slimer Oh, I didn't know that. And Slimer chemically out with him. Oh, well at least they cut that actually in rewatching this movie because I haven't seen this in a long time I re watched it for this commentary and I was actually pleasantly surprised at how little Slimer was in this. I remember him being in it more when I was a kid. I mean, like Slimer ice unless they caught him because he was in the cartoon. And I liked the cartoon, but I didn't like that they were incorporating elements from the cartoon in the movie. None of the Ghostbusters smoke anymore. Well, this movie was made for the kids. Yeah. And I was a kid and I hated that fact. There's a reason they're drilling the hole here the Geiger metre directly.

Mike:
It peaked. Yeah, it's where the baby carriage stops.

Rich:
taking drastic actions though. I do like Bill Murray in this scene. 

Jay:
Oh, yeah. This is a fun scene. It just doesn't really make much sense. 

Mike:
When the Ghostbusters are underdogs. It's fun. I don't know if this movie opened up with them being like, you know, city work like city heroes like what the Ghostbusters established and all that would be as fun you know.

Jay:
The first probably wouldn't be but there would be a different way to approach it. Like they mentioned at the beginning of this movie that after the events of the first one they got sued by like every organisation like that's, that's great. That's perfect, but to have them just not be Ghostbusters anymore. And also, the fact that nobody believes in ghosts anymore. Right? Like that makes no sense. Like after all the events of the first movie, a giant marshmallow man walked down the city streets but no one believes in anything supernatural anymore. Like did everybody just forget right? 

Rich:
Because proof of the existence of ghosts would change the world too much. You still want to ground the movie reality. 

Mike:
That's the thing it's though its Ghostbusters wasn't specifically ghosts. Totally it was more interdimensional beings. Yeah. Especially the ending it was an interdimensional God like attacking the earth. So, it wasn't like dead humans coming back to life or anything like that. It was more of like, alien thing. So, but you're right, it would change society dramatically. And writing that thing and to a sequel would be complex.

Jay:
But that couldn't make it interesting. I mean, there is like a certain level of sort of science element to these movies too. So, I can explore that a little.

Mike:
more through it all in the garbage. And listen to the people at the boardroom table who said this is the best way to make a whole bunch of money.

Rich:
Look Jay, you make a plot about slime so you can sell jars of slime. And you can also make a new backpack that they were that the kids will want to buy that shoot slime. 

Jay:
Did that happen? 

Rich:
Yep.  

Jay:
I don't remember that.

Mike:
They came up with the tanks that shoot the electrified slime or whatever. 

Jay:
they shoot at the Statue of Liberty. damn bad toys, though. 20 of everything. I don't remember that. I remember tonnes and tonnes of toys from the cartoon.

Mike:
Super Soakers are probably popular. Tank and the kids can shoot the water out of the tank and pretend to be Ghostbusters with the proton pack toy. I don't know what that did didn't have like, plastic? 

Jay:
Foam thing. You could stick the foam thing in the day would spin around.

Mike:
Didn't translate to a toy.

Rich: 
You just get the backpack and you pretend you're shooting your kid. 

Jay:
I have the proton pack. And that's what I did. 

Rich: 
Yeah. I got rid of the foam media. 

Jay:
Yeah, me too.

Mike:
Yeah, that's true. We used our imaginations.

Jay:
I remember playing Ghostbusters on the playground as a kid. Every kid played ghostbuster. It's true. So, kids just use cell phones. They use their Ghostbusters app.

Mike:
There's an app for that. The imagination app.

Rich: 
It tells you what to pretend. Is that how that works. I don't know how to play what do I do? 

Jay:
And then it just brings up a movie and then you just watch the movie. That's it. That's the imagination.

Mike:
Oh, lord.

Jay:
So, we're approaching the courtroom scene. Right? Isn't that after this? Yes. The courtroom scene is the equivalent of the Sedgwick hotel scene from the first movie. 

Mike:
The scene that kicks it off. Yeah, the end of the first act 30-page mark on the script. 

Jay:
I wonder what this how much of it is? Because I don't think anyone in the movie like especially Bill Murray was like that excited about making this. And it kind of comes across. But I wonder how much of the script turning out the way it did his laziness on Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis this part and how much of it is just the studio saying, just give us the exact same thing.

Mike:
The two screenwriters on this. 

Jay:
Isn't Dan Aykroyd the one that absolutely loves to Ghostbusters, though? He's the paranormal freak. And I can't. He's also the one that especially around this time, he had so many ideas. Like why would he just want to rehash the first movie?

Mike:
He probably got pushed down by Studio people.

Jay:
Yeah, they just said just give us the first movie again. 

Mike: 
They Ask him. 

Jay:
Let's call him up right now.

Mike:
We'll pretend we're going to talk to him by UFOs. I saw a UFO Documentary with Dan Aykroyd on and the whole thing. He was like on the Skype. It was just terrible. just babbling about UFO nonsense. 

Rich: 
Watch part of that. 

Rich: 
You remember you remember back in the day, we used to joke about calling up Harold Ramis and asking him that if you shot a living person with a proton pack with their soul be caught in the stream.

Mike:
Say leave me alone. I'm trying to sleep. So Janusz loves Sigourney Weaver, just like Lewis totally did. Yeah. And then comes to her apartment door and knocks on it, and she won't let him in. Just like Louise told me. This movie sucked.

Rich: 
Don't take any risks, Mike, don't take any risks. 

Jay:
The only movie I can think of that, that apes the first movie even more closely than this is like Teen Wolf too. the only difference is that he's in college, boxing instead of basketball. But other than that, it is the exact same movie.

Mike:
there's been proven successful track record of repeating the first movie and a sequel. You're doomed for your third one.

Jay:
Yeah, you can't repeat the same thing three times. you can trick people with one sequel. Oh, here's a bizarre thing. They introduce Winston in the scene, and then he just disappears from the rest of the scene. Where did he go? 

Rich 
You know, I noticed that too. But then I last night I read an explanation. No, really. There are only three proton packs on the desk.

Jay:
 But where is he in the scene? 

Rich: 
He apparently you can very briefly see him escorting people out but it's like it goes by really quick. 

Jay:
Okay. Maybe they shot a close up of it. And yes, and end up using Yeah. Well, that's something, I guess.

Mike:
Thank you for that explanation.

Jay
That's been driving me nuts since I was a kid. So, it is nice to know that there is somewhat of a reason for it.

Mike:
And here we have the Walter Peck equivalent. the man that hates the Ghostbusters for no reason. He is a bureaucrat, Walter peck at least, was working for the EPA. Yeah, had some mild c:oncerns about pollution, motivation. He had some motivation he was still a prick and hated the Ghostbusters for not much reason. 

Jay:
he tried to be as polite as someone like him could be in the situation. And he comes to the station and is sort of politely still kind of addict.

Rich: 
 to be fair, Peter rank, but it's a complete asshole. 

Jay:
Yeah, exactly. I want to know more about what you do. Yeah, nobody just completely shuts him down. And here yeah, this character is just a deck, played by Kurt Fuller, who played the same character in every movie around this time. He was in the Wayne's World movie. That's I would call that it. sequels in general are tricky. And comedy sequels are almost always a failure. But I would say Wayne's role, too, is a successful sequel. I like Wayne's World, too.

Mike:
I don't remember the difference between them.

Jay:
Wayne actually grows as a character in the second one. That's the problem is usually like in a comedy, they'll have their little arc and then the second movie, they don't know what to do with them. Like look at the second Austin Powers movie. Like that's the prime example of that, where the first movie he learns to stop being a womaniser. He falls in love with the Liz Hurley character. And then the second movie in the opening scene, they just say, oh, let's Hurley's a robot. Like Jesus Christ. I know they're goofy movies, but they do give them a little arc in the first movie. You have to give them something and then the second movie, they just throw that completely out the window.

Mike:
Those are set up and pay off joke movies, though. Just gags after gags.

Jay:
Sure. But you have to have a minor character arc for your character and then the first one had that and it's minor but it is an arc and then to just completely throw it out the window the second one, I like the second one okay but it's that drove that bugged me.

Mike:
you can't really compare it with NASA powers type movie to Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters I don't see it, there are comedies but it's not that kind of comedy.

Jay:
No, I'm not saying it.
 
Mike:
If this was just gag after gag after gag constant laughter like a Naked Gun movie type movie where it's just jokes and jokes, story doesn't matter that much. But this looks like ghost.

Rich:
just some one ghosts because they come out of the slime it almost seems like the slime makes ghosts.

Mike:
Now why isn't the slime, it's not green because it's not ectoplasm.

Rich:
you know it's purple because the slime they sold the cartoon show was purple. Yeah. Oh, was it Oh man you remember all these things from the cartoon? I don't remember. I don't remember the toy was provided the slime in the cartoon was can be any colour I think I sold purple slime.

Mike:
it was cheaper to dye the slime group purple. Is it that cynical in this movie? Are they probably didn't want to confuse it with the ectoplasm but yeah, did they call it ectoplasm the slime? because ectoplasm is a real thing like in paranormal speak. Yeah, it's like residue of ghosts. 

Rich: 
I'm pretty sure they call it ectoplasm, they called ectoplasm in the first one. 


Jay:
they call it slime over and over in this movie though, because that was a big line in the first movie slime to me.

Mike:
But the ectoplasm in a ghost sense is different than this pink slime, this is like solidification of bad emotions or something like that. So, it's different than like the residue of ghosts. Yeah, it's a completely different thing. 

Jay:
But yeah, it doesn't make no sense why this movie would just emerge.

Mike:
Well, it's just slime they just called slime. Yeah. And it's unrelated to the Vigo character I forget?

Jay:
it's related in a really sort of convoluted way.

Mike:
Yeah, but they show it painted on his pay.
 
Rich: 
How did it the Vigo put it there or is it coincidental that he's using it fuel itself or? 

Jay:
look at when these when these guys were put to the electric chair. Apparently, their chairs died with them.

Mike: 
And they look like the Pillsbury Doughboy.

Jay:
Ghosts can wear clothes; they can have electric. 

Mike:
yeah, so why do they come out of the slime? Yeah, this is the question because I don't know. Because this we need a scene that gets the Ghostbusters back into business. 

Jay:
this is the equivalent of the Slimer scene in the first movie. Top notch effects for the time though.

Mike:
Yeah, those ghosts look too cartoony, though. 

Jay:
you can say that about Slimer in the first movie, too, though. I like that a lot of the ghosts in the first movie are like there's that skeleton cab driver and there's a lot of them that are more grounded in a realistic look. 

Mike: 
the librarian ghosts. And that was the way to do that. 

Jay:
Yeah, these look more like toys you would sell from the carton show. 

Mike:
They should have looked more like old serial killer guys flying around. wouldn't have been a little scared little kid. This is the baby Ghostbusters. No, sex jokes. No smoking. 

Rich:
Why not? Kids like the first movie a lot. Why tame it down when the first movie had the same appeal?

Mike:
Because adults don't give kids enough credit to separate things in their brain or not understand things. 

Jay:
There definitely was a shift from the early 80s to the late 80s. When you look at movies like kidsâ€™ movies that came out in the early 80s. They definitely were darker than where the decade ended.
People caught that a lot. I never cared much for that joke.

Rich: 
before at the end of the scene. Two in the box ready to go. 

Jay:
See, I don't think I like that one either. It feels like they're trying too hard to come up with little catchphrases with a set of letting them happen and there are a lot of lines in the set feel natural, that are more quotable to me because they are they don't feel like they're trying hard. 

Rich: 
I don't think this is anywhere near as quotable as the first one. I can't think of any classic Ghostbusters two quotes.

Mike: 
There's a couple.

Jay:
There's a few there's lots of good lines. I wouldn't call them like famous quotes, but there's lots of funny lines in it. 

Rich: 
Every line spoken on the first one is a famous quote now.

Mike: 
The flowers are still stuck. Even when he does that, 

Jay:
We are at that point in this movie too. Yeah, this is that same scene. And then it's immediately followed up with a montage music montage of them catching. 

Mike:
Ghosts suddenly back in business. I guess you could say that with the first one though. Like, suddenly there was a montage of them being back in business.

Jay:

well, it's their business growing and the first one and then there is an explanation as to why all this normal stuff is happening. Yeah, this one kind of is to do with the pink slime. But a slime is getting more powerful, but it still doesn't explain how ghosts just come out of the slime. You're not supposed to care. they're catching ghosts. And that's it.

Mike: 
It's movies insulting.

Rich: 
You know, as a kid, it always bugged me that they weren't wearing their uniforms during this scene. They're in a court. I was a kid. I wanted to see the Ghostbusters and their jumpsuit shooting goes not in suits. 

Jay:
You'll see plenty of that later. You can still see that today. Actually, if you go to a convention that Ernie Hudson is that he actually wears the Ghostbusters uniform at conventions. 

Mike:
Yeah, that's so sad. That's the line that you should never cross. Oh, now we're back.

Jay:
Apparently whatever job Janine had in between the first movie in this one. She felt it was worth giving up. So, she could be a receptionist again.

Mike:
Yeah, she wasn't working the last three years running down the street.

Jay:
And then oh, the sign. We visited the Ghostbusters fire station once and they let them keep that sign after this movie. They have it hanging in the front of the building there on the inside of the building. So that was kind of need to see.

Mike: 
That's right, we're back. All of a sudden,

Rich: 
Slightly uglier car.

Mike: 
I guess the slime seeping out.

Jay:
It's bubbling its way up to the surface, I guess. I like this ghost. The Joker says a good bit. This is fun. This is the music ruins this montage sequence for me though. I like the song.

Rich: 
I hated it.

Mike: 
It was the rap song. 

Jay:
There's a number of those in this Yeah, the score in general is kind of landed in this I don't know if I'd say bad but no, it's not bad. It's no fucking Elmer Bernstein. No, it's off.

Mike:
This is slightly different. This is this character seeing their TV commercial as opposed to Sigourney Weaver. Bad TV commercial. So, I think it's probably edited with the exact same shots and pacing.

Jay:
Montage or that bit.

Mike: 
Maybe the whole montage too. Why not? 

Jay:
I do know that this bit here were Ray runs red light was part of a longer sequence where Ray apparently gets possessed by a ghost or something. That was all cut out. I remember reading that somewhere. It seemed possessed by the painting. Everybody stares at the painting. Oh, maybe it's related to that. it would make sense. What the fuck is that thing? I never understood this. It never shows up again. it doesn't show up again in the cartoons. It's just some weird Ghostbuster laser thing that is used only once.

Mike:
They did a thing with the traps. They're catching it goes through stealing diamonds or something. I like that little thing makes a thing like they're doing some sort of wacky Ghostbusters. Oh, there is a scene where she's not exercising, she's feeding her baby.

Jay:
oh, that scene in the first movie when the like I said it's later that's not during the montage but when she's sitting in the chair and then the human hands come out of the chair like that's the prime example of scary scene that would not be in a kid's movie by the end of the decade.

Mike:
Okay, so here's a little experimentation see what does the equivalency of this?

Jay:
research on Gazer looking them up in the guide maybe.

Jay:
Yeah, not every single scene is a direct lift but most of the main ordinary sense.

Mike: 
Damn it. 

Jay:
No, most of them, I'm not going to say every single one.

Mike:
Every shot is the same. I of course I'm being humorous. Yeah, I know every scene isn't identical but you lay down the plot points in the structure or they would line up.

Jay:
Oh yeah. 

Mike:
Almost right down ugly. Yeah, this is so cartoon show. You know, this scene. Winston. They're hanging out like All he wanted to do in the first one was get paid now, he's helping investigate like he didn't care at all before he just wanted a job yeah now, he's a ghost by always a ghost buster yeah just like the cartoon show.

Jay:
Although they do insinuate here that Egon had sex with the slime yeah just fun.

Jay:
something that always bothered me is a kid about this toaster scene coming up and it's a minor nit-pick but it bugged me they pour the slime in there and the dances around and then two pieces of toast shoot out one toe step slime all over it where the slime go? 

Rich:
the slime all went in the toaster around the toaster. 

Jay:
the slime actually is it has to avoid the toast that's its weakness of the toast.

Mike: 
it wouldn't the toast come alive and start dancing too.

Jay:
that would have been fun. Possess toast.

Mike:
So, they just got their firehouse back, just really paying rent on it for three years. Five years. I guess they purchased it right?

Jay:
They Yeah, they put out a third mortgage and raise house. 18%

Mike: 
18%, You didn't even argue.

Jay:
And that's an aspect of the movie. The first movie I really love, things I've appreciated about that movie different things as I've gotten older like that's the most recent one is all the detail put into like these shrubby guys trying to start a business like I like that aspect of it. 

Rich: 
You can identify with that. 

Jay:
Exactly. They get this this they start working in a dumpy building. All things I can relate to. 

Jay: 
My second favourite show after Bassmasterâ€™s, and then Bill Murray hates him after that. it's a fishing show.

Mike: 
Yeah, I know best moments like that.

Jay:
Yeah, there's lots of little moments that make this movie. What? That's not one of the good moments. The painting smirking. does bother me? No, no. Why does it do that? Because it's evil.

Mike:
He knows she recently had a baby and he's wants to get that baby to take over his body. 

Jay:
because it has to be her baby. It has to be her baby. She has to be directly linked to the main threat. 

Rich: 
because she's a major character. 

Jay:
Yeah, the simplest of things you could have changed like she could have just been Venkman his girlfriend maybe they could have been married whatever. But not have her directly linked to the main plot

Mike: 
could have been Venkmanâ€™s baby. 

Jay:
So many little tweaks. You could do. 

Mike:
You wouldn't have the sexual tension like the him trying to win her over?

Jay:
Sure. Maybe they haven't done their relationship. You got to stick with what worked in the first one.

Mike: 
and recreate.

Rich: 
Peter Venkman is an asshole and I can't see any relationship working with him. he's a funny character if he were just counter in real life, as you. 

Jay:
fun fact I didn't realise until recently. Vigo his voice. It's not that actor's voice. It's dubbed over by Max von Sydow, Whatever the exorcist I never knew that he dumped over his voice until recently. I also did not know I found this out recently that this the VHS release of this movie, when it first came out on VHS. There was a version of it. That was letterbox it was one of the very first letterbox VHS. But it wasn't letterbox in the theatrical aspect ratio. It was a less narrow aspect ratio. So, they still did pan and scan. So, it was letterbox and pan and scan pleasing nobody. 

Mike: 
Oh, not the scene. 

Jay:
This scene, I vividly remember seeing the theatre. because there was some like drunk hooligans in the theatre. And they started yelling when she takes off her shirt. They started yelling, like, take it off. And I was like, there was my dad. It was horribly awkward. 

Mike:
I think this is the moment when they show the cartoon bathtub. That's the moment that lost me. I was on board up until that moment. When the bathtub like is trying to grab her and it looks like so terrible. And I was like I think that was it. That was it. That was that was fine. Ever outline and the painting and all the other stuff but it looks so terrible.

Jay:
I don't remember any specific moment whereas like, I just remember the movie overall once it was over like it was the same movie. 

Rich: 
I know the rap montage started to dislodge a bit. 

Jay:
Okay. I didn't mind the music in this Bobby Brown song.

Mike:
Bobby Brown cameo too. And he got the proton packs. Not a toy. 

Jay:
Oh no. Slime. Why is he laying down on the couch sleeping on the couch in his clothes here? He looks like he's like hungover or something. I wonder if there was a scene that was deleted. Possibly. It's very it's just an awkward way.

Mike:
Have you ever seen the deleted scenes from this then? 

Jay:
I don't think they exist. 

Mike: 
like a barebones?

Jay:
I don't think anybody's seen them? Yeah, there's never been any sort of special edition of this movie. 

Rich: 
I've read about them I've seen still images.

Mike:
we they release everything on Blu Ray Now like Why wouldn't they do?

Jay:
I don't know. I don't think anybody cares about Ghostbusters two. 

Rich: 
You could get away with it. The people would buy it.

Mike: 
Yeah, sure.

Jay:
Yeah, I would just because I'm here and like the movie.

Mike:
like rough crappy, you know, mastered versions of the scenes. I would be okay with it. Because the ones on the release of Blu-ray release of the first one is there in bad shape? Very bad shape.

Rich: 
I know there's a lot of deleted Slimer stuff. There's a deleted scene where they put the Statue of Liberty back

Jay:
 that was actually in rewatching this that was something I was curious about. There was a scene of that?

Rich: 
 I don't know if it actually shows going back on the pedestal but I know there's like a ceremony by the Statue of Liberty with dialogue and everything. 

Jay:
they're explaining there's a connection between Vigo and the slime of some sort.

Rich: 
but did he make the slime to go in New York City because he knew he was going to be in a painting in New York City?

Jay:
that's a very good question. And if he was stuck in the painting, how did he do such a thing?

Mike: 
Nobody knows.

Jay:
Did he know that New York City would exist someday? 
These are all very good questions. I do you like the way Bill Murray interacts with the baby in the scene. I think it's cute.

Mike:
Vigo control ghosts? Because it doesn't sound like the witch Wicked Witch of the well [crosstalk]

Jay:
that part makes no sense. Because he kind of possesses. 

Mike: 
Yeah, Yanosh should really kidnapped the witch. 

Rich: 
It was Yanosh. Only he was a ghost. He was ghost Yanosh.

Jay:
somehow the ghosts convinced the baby to climb out on the ledge before it got there. 

Rich: 
Maybe Vigo killed the Yanosh? 
And then [Afry?] kidnapped the baby and he like to restarted his heart. 

Jay:
instead of just having Yanosh, I mean I guess it's for like ghostâ€™s visual sake. But yeah, you could just have Yanosh possessed Yanosh show up and steal the baby show up with the gun. God What are you going to do? Yeah, maybe it was a case of like, we haven't had a ghost for a while in the movie. So, we have to have a scene with the ghosts. this is funny. She says she's going to he wants her to help her put down the baby. So, then he insults the baby. That's funny. how often in this movie is Bill Murray actually in the Ghostbusters uniform? 

Rich: 
He didn't want anything to do with this movie. Yeah, he's never in the costume.

Mike: 
I don't even think at the end. Yeah, he goes on a date. They go out for dinner.

Jay:
Yeah, I think yeah, I don't even think at the end of the movies in the uniform. After the Get out of prison. I mean, after they get out of the asylum that's another parallel that's coming up. 

Rich: 
I don't know this scene has an equivalent where they're examining the painting.

Jay:
I'm assuming the museum didn't call them, they're just kind of barging in here.

Mike:
the previous scene showed Egon making the connection between Vigo, right? So, then they just show up. Do they know the paintings there? 

Jay:
I guess, they know the paintings. Okay, but theoretically Yanosh could just call the cops. they have no legal right to be in here in the painting. 

Mike:
distracting him while they because he keeps telling him to get out so yeah, they don't have a right to be there. they're working undercover or the Ghostbusters well the odds are against them.

Jay:
If you're going to cut off the little side story with Ray getting possessed why include this where he's like staring at the painting and because that doesn't pay off in any way maybe just the very end kind of vaguely though Yeah.

Mike: 
No, it does well. it's over Ray body at the end. 

Rich: 
he does but it doesn't it goes by so quick though. It's like why do it at all? 

Mike: 
Yeah, exactly. Why do anything?

Jay:
I guess because you have to have something happened in the movie especially at the end to make it seem like there's some threat.

Mike:
that's the only thing that happens that's some kind of interesting twist or anything because really all they do is just.

Jay:
They did a shoot at it with slime and proton packs.

Mike:
and then having him jump out of the painting into Ray's body at the last minute is some mild threat.

Jay:
that's immediately discarded.

Mike:
Yeah, but if they established like Vigo painting with like constantly possessed people and take over it would have some sort of impact but okay, was this the room?

Jay:
Go, no, that shot didn't go on long enough for it to be the room. Yeah, I didn't really think about he spends this whole movie wearing this jacket. He's never in this costume. it'd be alright if I knew it was like a character choice and not just Bill Murray not wanting to wear the stupid costume anymore.

Mike: 
Well, Peter Venkman was never really a ghost. he was always just trying to con his way. 

Jay:
it's funny at the end of the first movie when everyone's covered in marshmallow fluff and he just has like a tiny bit on its shoulder.

Mike:
He's not a uniform guy. The other two are.

Jay:
Winston?

Mike:
Because, he asked to wear his uniform for work. And Ray and Egon are nerds.

Rich: 
They love what they do. They love being ghosts. Yes. Peter Venkman does not.

Jay:
So, when they reboot Ghostbusters, we talked about it a little bit but what other elements will be in the new Ghostbusters movie.

Mike: 
Flying Ghostbusters car.

Jay:
The car will fly?

Mike: 
Yeah. 

Rich: 
I was assuming a sequel or a reboot. 

Jay:
It'll be a reboot. Even if they have the you know, even if Errol during it or not Harold Ramis? Oh my god. Even if Dan Aykroyd shows up for like one scene. It's he's still it'll be one season. It'll be a wink. But he won't be a major part of the movie. 

Rich: 
Because I'm just wondering how They'll ruin like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

Jay:
Oh, if they won't do a direct remake of the first movie. It won't be another movie with Ghostbusters. Yeah, I don't think they would do that.

Mike:
No, not if they're including. 

Jay:
if they didn't include anyone from the first movie. I don't think they would just remake the first movie. I think it would just be another movie with Ghostbusters I don't know about the flying car though Actually. I think that might be too futuristic.

Mike:
or it's too goofy. Definitely the I don't know what model or make the car would be but it would be a Ghostbusters car. But it would be sleek.

Rich: 
it wouldn't be an old Junker. Would it be like a product placement car though? It won't be like a funny car. It wouldn't be like Ford Explorer.

Mike: 
Sure. Probably.

Jay:
Maybe they got paid to you on the movie. 

Mike: 
Yeah. And it would be eco friendly.

Jay:
Sure, it would run on ectoplasm and rewatching this movie I didn't remember how little of the fire house we actually see in this movie. They're not there very often though. 

Mike: 
okay, there's this subplot.

Jay:
Yeah. We have to put them in there because they were in the first movie. I guess we have to give them something to do. But yeah, she's got like the leopard print. You know, coat the bright green gloves and the bright red hair like this is not the same person from the first movie. 

Rich: 
Ghostbusters. One Janine would just be annoyed but what's this asshole that's what she would say. Get away from me. Oh, Winston has something to do in the scene. He saves the day.

Mike: 
He comes down with a fire extinguisher. 

Jay:
because Bill Murray doesn't care. So, he's not in half the movie. A something that he would do to Winston. 

Mike: 
we're talking about what they want for dinner. I like yeah, that's fine. Oh, Vigo did that. he loves pictures. No, he lives on images. That's his thing.

Jay:
Sure. I don't know. Just seems like they come up with vague ways to connect any sort of supernatural shenanigans. He's in pictures. So, then they're locked in the room like, oh, and they can just create ghosts out of slime.

Mike: 
This is mildly scary scene. 

Jay:
no, this is okay. You at least feel like they're in some little bit of danger. But it doesn't end cleverly at all. Winston. Just Boston. 

Mike: 
It's establishing the threat of ego. Is there something?

Rich: 
It's not the worst scene in the movie. It's fine. We'll do the movie where I don't want to cause there's a number of scenes like this in the movie where the other three show up to tell Bill Murray something and then he just leaves the scene. And they go off and do something else. 

Rich: 
However, the only way that give Bill Murray to do it is I don't want to be covered in slime. I don't want to wear that heavy backpack. Yeah, that he probably had a shit tonne of stipulations. I want to do as little as possible. 

Jay:
But then I've heard him like in recent years him complain about the lack of quality of the second Ghostbusters movie. You're like, well, you kind of contributed to that. By not wanting to do anything and it just shouldn't have done it at all. I did. Like he was on Letterman a few years ago, and Letterman mentioned he's like they did Ghostbusters. And there was a Ghostbusters two. And then Bill Murray just goes well, technically, yeah. 

Rich: 
There are people who hate him for not wanting to do the third one. I applaud him. 

Jay:
I don't blame him. He knows exactly what it'll be. 

Rich: 
And this seemed doesn't work for me because Peter Vacanze not there. The chemistry is off without those three characters. 

Jay:
Yeah, I did. Like there was a moment here that kind of creeped me out as a kid though, when they're yelling when they hear the echo and then Winston yells and there's no echo. Yeah. That kind of creeped me out. But then it's spoiled with the goofy demon voice yelling Winston.

Mike: 
And the ghost train. Don't forget about that. Because

Jay:
yeah, trains have souls.
I guess. It's a ghost train.

Jay:
It's straight. It's there. There's nothing like them. The first one right. It is ghosts of people or interdimensional them.

Mike:
This is the first one when the Titanic comes back. 

Jay:
Did you really ask that if that happened in the first one? 

Mike: 
I did. 

Rich: 
It should be something that could have happened. There was a scene near the end when things were getting kooky. It could have happened in the first one because that's another scene that parallels.

Rich: 
And the first one it said that like we're saying I don't remember where he's having like a giant ghost and like a park or something. and that's kind of like the equivalent of the Titanic showing a giant ghost in a park.
I was like under some kind of charge or something. Yes, this one. Is that this one? This one too. Oh, okay.

Mike: 
I think that's the first one.
 
Rich: 
Now you'll see later
last 2021

Mike: 
It has the big arms.

Jay:
it shows up in this one. Trust me I just rewatch the series.

Rich: 
Okay, I did do though.

Jay:
that's sad no there's no inanimate object ghosts in the first no. 

Rich:
if there was like a train derailment and the train is a manifestation of like a whole bunch of souls, I'm okay with it okay with the goes straight, okay.

Mike:
Ghosts are thing people say that they have ghosts in it. 

Rich: 
You know ghostsâ€™ ships, ghostsâ€™ trains, about the equivalent of a ghost ship. I'm okay with that.

Jay:
What does Dan Aykroyd think about these things though?

Rich: 
He probably fully believes in them. 

Jay:
two hours about it. Yeah. 

Mike: 
No, the ghost train is really a UFO. This too goofy. 

Jay:
This this is kind of goofy. His face? Yeah. Winston's dead Wait. I watched the kid the cartoon all the time as a kid but I don't remember much of it anymore. But did Winston had more to do in the cartoon? 

Rich: 
When they're all kind of had equal screentime.

Jay:
Yeah. Did he have more of a character in the cartoon?

Mike:  
Not really. 

Jay:
He was still just the other the other Ghostbuster guy. 

Rich: 
is the down to earth one. they treated him like an equal partner I mean the really, he should just be the employee.

Jay:
yeah, that would have been more interesting dynamic if they kind of shit on him a little bit like not like horrible assholes but just treated him like a made him do all the grunt work like there would have been a different angle.

Mike: 
Unbelievable, right.

Jay:
That's interesting. Rich saying that the slime was a toy sold before this movie existed. I did not know that. And it completely explains the existence of this movie.

Rich: 
I think they started selling in 87 or 88. But it was it came out with a cartoon sort of coming out.

Jay:
Okay. When was Ecto Cooler introduced?

Rich: 
I'm going to say after this.

Jay:
Well, the cartoon was still on after this. Yeah. I just remember Ecto Cooler existed until like the early 2000s I remember seeing it in the store is like Ecto Cooler is still around. 

Rich:
Might still do I think they just changed the name. Okay, eventually they just lost the rights. They did. I thought it was like called like Schouten orange tangerine or something weird.

Jay:
It was Yeah, it wasn't called ecto cooler but up until like 2000 2001 It was still Ecto Cooler. 

Rich: 
Okay, okay, back to the movie.

Jay:
Talking about Ecto Cooler is more interesting in the movie at this point. Sigourney Weaver. Her character knows that this is a serious threat. And she just doesn't care. She just wants to go out to dinner like when they confront these to outside that apartment building to say we're going to go check out the river slime there's this big problem. She knows it's a problem and she just want to go home.

Mike:
before the Gozer was in her icebox and then she doesn't know at this point that that the Vigo wants her baby right now I guess she does crap about the river slime. Okay. But she doesn't really care about anything in this movie.

Jay:
She doesn't care about anything in the movies? 

Mike: 
Her bathtub did try to attack her.

Jay:
Yeah, she knows the slime of the thread. I don't think she knows specifically that he wants her baby. but 

Rich: 
Does the slime tried to grab a baby or just wasn't she worried about the baby though when she showed up?

Mike: 
She didn't want to stay there. 

Jay:
She's concerned about the safety of her baby because there's slime monsters in her apartment that makes sense but she doesn't know specifically that Vigo is trying to take the baby.

Mike: 
Vigo is gonna possess her baby.

Rich:
It still thinks she want to be around her baby until this is cleared out. For sure.

Jay:
but when you got Louis totally to watch your baby then they got nothing to worry about.

Rich: 
She said that she did not like this man at all. This is so wrong.

Mike: 
Because they have glass and they're quirky.

Jay:
They're both quirky. I guess you liked Egon. Well, that made sense in the first movie. He owns kind of nerdy. 

Mike: 
I'm usually very like it, I believe you couldn't die. Oh, God. They posted that clip online.

Jay:
I don't know actually. 

Mike:
That's pretty awful sorry. 

Jay:
rest in peace Harold's

Mike:
I like that scene.

Jay:
Yeah, no, it's a good scene. I wouldn't have even made the connection if you hadn't. 

Mike:
Yeah, I didn't make the connection until I just said it. But that scene does exist in the first Ghostbusters movie. And she was right.

Rich:
Well, she right if she said that to anybody, Mike had some 30 years after the prediction.

Mike:
He was the first one woman to die from the Ghostbusters.

Jay:
such a shame.

Jay:
that's actually something Jason Reitman said after Harold Ramis died that I kind of didn't really think about but he said for people of a certain age Pilgrim is dying is like one of the Beatles dying and it's true.

Mike:
Fancy dinner scene being interrupted. The equivalent of the Tavern on the Green Scene. Yeah.

Jay:
These are all smart people. They're smart scientists. They're acting completely out of character here to be like freaking out and flipping slime everywhere. They get excited. this doesn't bother me. But they're still rational people like it wasn't there.

Rich:
Then Winston is there as weird. He should just be, I want to go home now.

Jay:
they really should have played up Winston just being a guy. It would have made him interesting. Yeah. Other than him just being there for no reason.

Rich:
Him being one of the groups with not much of a personality does not work for me. 

Mike:
Him being in the sequel at all. It's unnecessary from a character perspective,

Rich: 
but at least work if they played him up as an employer. 

Mike:
Sure. If there was a reason for him to have to work with a Ghostbuster Yeah, he contractually obligated or court order or something. Oh, that would have been good. Yeah. He doesn't want to be there. 

Rich:
The last time I was with you guys. I almost got killed by a giant marshmallow. Right. Make it a joke. Yeah.

Jesse
nobody's bothered by the fact that I'm dressed the same all the time.

Rich: 
Jesse What the fuck are you doing here?

Mike: 
Just appeared.

Jay:
weird. Are you a ghost? 

Jesse
No. I am sorry.

Mike: 
Yeah. Why are they all wearing? Like long underwear?

Jay:
No, that's what they were under there. because firefighters do that?

Mike:
that was always the theme. Sort of. Because cartoon show laundry.

Rich: 
Their underwear is not a problem.

Jay:
It's a minor problem. A very minor problem. Did you ever see the revived Ghostbusters cartoon with the ethnically diverse?

Rich:
No fucking interested the Revive cartoon? Because it wasn't Peter Venkman.

Jay:
He was like their mentor. But there was like a kid in a wheelchair dance.

Rich:
Yeah, and politically correct. Post Ghostbusters. Bullshit. I have a multi concert.

Jay:
When was that on? When did that cartoon air? 

Rich: 
Mid 90s. 

Mike: 
I'm assuming early to mid 90s.

Jay:
Well, not early because the original cartoon would still be on. Yeah. Oh, here's where they meet with the mayor.

Mike: 
Just like they met with the mayor before.

Jay:
Walter Peck equivalent characters there. remember Mayor the time we save the city. And we're warning you that there's problems again, but you don't believe us for no reason.

Rich:
I'm actually kind of shocked. It isn't Walter pack. For Reason.

Jay:
They figured that would be too much. That would be that's the tipping of the scale. We put Walter pack in it. people realise we're remaking the movie again.

Mike: 
I understand what they're talking about.

Jay:
Yeah, the mayor is just completely sceptical even though all this has happened before.

Rich: 
I don't believe in ghosts anymore.

Jay:
I think there's some line in this where someone says that they'd like. It was like don't they make some try and explain some reason why people would not believe them mass delusion or something like that like one just completely stupid line.

Jay:
Bill Murray saying I'll be in the sequel, the scene where you guys are in your long underwear. Find a way to not have me in that scene. I'll show up in a suit. Yeah, the idea that there's some sort of like threat like the slime or whatever it could be that that is feeding off the negativity of New York City is an interesting idea.

Rich:
You'd have to show like New Yorkers being terrible to each other. 

Jay:
They don't establish any of that. 

Mike: 
there should be like, horrible riots happening outside.

Jay:
Yeah, yeah. early on. In the movie, you show people being dicks to each other?

Mike: 
If that's your only concept if the slime is just making people angry, but they have to throw ghosts in there on top of that, right? Like can't do both. Can't go smoothly without ghosts. 

Rich:
And then it would actually work at the end when everyone starts cheering for New Year's Eve.

Jay:
But that is corny ending in its own right. But if you're going to do something like that, you have to establish that everybody's being assholes to each other. It's like the new Robocop movie where they don't establish that Detroit is a crime ridden hellhole.

Mike:
Yeah, there's no evidence that the slime is doing anything negative. other than when they got covered in it. Bill Murray should just still be in this suit.

Jay:
I'm not going to wear the straight jacket. Let's see. Oh, there's Brian Doyle Murray. Bill Murray's brother. Popping up for a little pay check. I almost said cameo.

Rich
Has he been in any movie that Bill Murray wasn't in? 

Jay:
Yeah, he's been in stuff. He was in cabin boy. The Chris Elliott masterpiece. He's actually on the Chris Elliott show. Get a life. Which did you ever watch get alive?

Rich: 
Not really.

Jay:
The early episodes of that show are great. Oh, yeah. 

Mike: 
He was in Christmas vacation. Without Belmar?

Jay:
Yes, It's true. He was the boss. Oh, yeah. he's done stuff. Bring me the chai command me my Lord.

Rich: 
Now he gets turned into a ghost somehow.

Jay:
Yeah, not a lot of humour. In the second half of this movie is there?

Jay:
It's a lot of acts grinding, as they say.

Mike:
And these candles are absolutely necessary. They are original. 

Jay:
I'm okay with that. It adds atmosphere or whatever.

Mike:
Life to you? Yeah, maybe Vigo gives some magical powers to turn into a witch.

Jay:
But he's a grandparent. Yeah, he's not just flying he's a ghost magic power.

Mike:
He said he was Vigo was a powerful magician that is aligned in the film. 

Rich: 
He clearly turns him into a ghost.

Jay:
you can be a magician. But how do you make someone a ghost?

 Mike: 
Magic.

Jay:
Just magic?

Mike: 
Carpathian magic. So why haven't they left?

Jay:
They're hanging out the keeper company. They have a line about it. 
Mike:
Mike: 
And she wants to believe they're just on a date.

Jay:
They think they're doing something nice for her by keeping her company until Venkman comes home. But she doesn't want him there. They don't have a crib. She fled her apartment.

Mike:
Oh, that's right. Pay attention like I wouldn't you hold her baby after she's just got home from a long night.

Rich: 
Maybe she was holding the baby for an hour. 

Jay:
Now, she thinks the baby's sleeping. When she comes back. They have a line about it.

Mike:
I am okay, these are all fine.

Jay:
I just saw there's a little box of ice on the table there and it just had the thought that what if they had put ecto cooler in the movie? Like they put the Ghostbusters song in the movie in the world of the movie? What if there was ecto cooler in this movie? Surprise they didn't do that.

Mike:
Ghostbusters have their own products. Oh my God, little babies. 

Jay:
See that's actually an angle you could take though, but they're like glamour drink. They would have their own products. Yeah, they will make a Slimer drink but the idea of them like creating all this merchandising and stuff like you could do something with that.

Rich:
didn't save the world I could see somebody writing a Ghostbusters song that just happened to be the Ray Parker Jr. Ghostbusters song.

Jay:
so yeah, here's our ghost Manny Yanosh complete with Ghost baby carriage and a weird ass outfit. well, he's supposed to be like a nanny. nothing that's happening right now makes any sense.

Mike:
I never saw it as like I guess so evil nanny, reminded me of Wizard of Oz with that

Rich: 
it looks kind of like that. But

Mike:
She's riding a bike, right? Yeah, Well the witches flying in a broom in that. 

Rich:
Which kind of a broom but the earlier on when the stolen Kansas? Yeah. And she is going on a bike.

Mike:
Yeah. She's just a mean old lady who becomes the Witch and the dream. Yeah. Realise she just hates total.

Jay:
So, he was the equivalent of them being in jail scene. Only this time we're not getting any exposition. It's just the scene.

Rich: 
Though. This is no joke, though. With Bill Murray.

Jay:
saying these guys are crazy. Yeah, sure. Does the scene justify its existence by having that one joke though? There's no purpose to this at this point. It's just a scene. 

Rich: 
I'm sure that they're in the institution. I'm okay with the scene.

Jay:
That's the great thing about the jail scene in the first one is we get a lot of information. Yeah. 

Mike: 
Yeah, this is sort of information. 

Jay:
It's just reiterating things we already know.

Mike: 
Oh, my God.

Jay:
So even though Dana Barrett knows that there's a supernatural threat that has a baby that she probably cannot do anything about on her own. She doesn't bother to try and find the Ghostbusters. she just goes right to the museum. What does she plan on doing?

Mike:
She's acting on instinct to save her baby. 

Jay:
But what's she going to do? Well, you know, she knows people that hunt ghosts

Rich:
Why doesn't she get a hold of them? They're in the middle of setup. 

Jay:
but she doesn't know that.

Mike:
Maybe she tried to call and what did she know? 

Jay:
She didn't just flee the apartment and went right there. Why do you hate when you got to be hated? 

Rich:
I'm just trying to find some logic in her actions.

Mike:
So okay, Vigo wants a new body. 

Jay:
Even thoughMike: it comes out of the painting at the end, so he has a body.

Rich:
What's a ghost body? He doesn't want to ghost body. He wants a baby body. Oh,

Mike:
that's right. They have to do this. I was like What Why didn't you just go and fly a ghost out to grab a baby like, like six days ago. But they have to do it some ritualistic sometimes.

Jay:Mike:
there's some explanation for it. 

Mike:
Forgot about that. Okay, so to catch record on fire. Go for those candles now,

Rich: 
Okay, go ahead. Now you go first.

Jay:
I was gonna say now she's wearing Venkman code. Is that like a passing of the I don't want to be in this movie anymore. But

Mike: 
Yes,

Jay:
I'm done with this. I'm Ripley. Dammit. Get me out of here. She's got to kill time for the next elegant movie. Where did this would have been after aliens? Right?

Rich:
And what about after aliens? I'm not sure probably before alien. more alien three, though.

Mike:
Sure. Aliens was 86. Alien three was 92.

Jay:
Sure.

Mike: 
So, in betwMike:een the two aliens. 

Jay:
That's disappointing. You win an Academy Award for playing an awesome character and then you're just damsel in distress and Ghostbusterâ€™s sequel. do worse. And here's the Yeah, this is the montage from the first movie of the ghost taking over the city. Now we'll see if that goes, we're talking about shows up here. I can tell you that it does. But hadn't during the day. No. It's during this sequence. This bit I guess here with the code was something that was originally planned for the first movie. Yeah, I like this a little bit.
Mike:
Jay:
let's scurries down the sidewalk. I like that.

Mike:
Slime touching her shoes.
 
Jay:
As established earlier in the movie. The slime doesn't have to touch anything. Oh my God. You're right there it is. But this movie doesn't deal with inter dimensional beings so why is there a giant monster? In this movie It's just ghosts.

Rich: 
Maybe that was a [unaidable] ghosts.

Mike:
Ghosts, have souls. They're all in heaven with Jesus. What's so funny.

Jay:
There's the famous Titanic sequence for the odd Cheech Marin cameos. Like if you're going to put a celebrity cameo, why would you think you would aim higher than Cheech Marin? It wasn't even popular at that point.

Mike:
The whole on the Titanic is completely inaccurate too.

Rich:
They found the Titanic by that point too. So, they knew what shape it was in.

Mike:
but they didn't know about that.

Jay:
Philip Baker Hall he shows up for one line. And Ben Stein also shows up for one line

Rich:
everybody wants to be in Ghostbusters.

Jay:
These are all people who have done stuff by this point it's weird that it's like Ben Stein was kind of famous from Ferris Bueller it was never huge but he would show up. he would be that guy in movies and here he's just like a background extra almost.

Jay:
Kurt fuller still doesn't believe in ghosts even though the city's run with ghosts.

Mike:
you want they're in jail. I mean the hospital.

Rich:
Mike, they changed it from jail to the hospital. That's something different, All right.

Mike: 
You are breaking new ground.

Jay:
I was gonna say you actually see them leaving the psych ward in this which is different but you do see him leaving the jail in the first movie so never mind. They get out. they have a live he says Have you ever seen anything like this before? And I was thinking yeah.

Mike:
what does that have to do with the slime?

Jay:
Oh, look he put the suit. See end of the movie. Wait, we have seemed a team player Bill Murray.

Rich:
More power to him. 

Jay:
I you know, yeah, he has some funny stuff in this movie. But I know he didn't want to do it. So, the fact that you get anything out of it. He is impressive.

Rich:
He understood that the first movie did not need a sequel.

Jay:
Yeah, he's not interested in living in the past.

Rich:
And you can hate him for that. But he's right. And he's justified and he doesn't owe you anything.

Jay:
Exactly. I'm looking at where his career has gone compared to Dan Ackroyd.

Rich:
I love Dan Aykroyd, I do. 

Jay:
Sure, but Blues Brothers 2000.

Rich: 
Yeah, I know.

Jay:
Bill Murray's taking some chances tried some different things hasn't always been successful, but he's at least tried. I guess Dan Akroyd tried he made nothing but trouble.

Rich: 
You forgetting my stepmother was an alien, Jay.

Jay:
Oh god, you're right. I am.

Mike: 
That's a classic.

Rich: 
That's a classic Coneheads.

Jay:
Oh, Jesus. Actually, out of just random curiosity recently rewashed Coneheads, there's no jokes in that movie. There are no actual jokes. That whole movie is just Dan Aykroyd does something weird.

Mike: 
And they eat Subway. 

Jay:
They eat Subway.

Jay:
Yeah, going back to what we were saying about like collaboration and stuff that the like comedies the generation of comedies and comedians after this era was so different. It was like everything was a vehicle. Like there's the Jim Carrey vehicles as Adam Sandler vehicles like there's just that one funny person is supposed to be funny person. It was less collaborative. And that's kind of come back around now with like the Judd Apatow group and it's more of a collaborative effort to be funny and not just one person saying Look at me on funny.

Rich: 
The video game is a better sequel.

Jay:
A better sequel than the non-existent Ghostbusters three.

Rich:
better than GMike:hostbusters two and then the night exists equal.

Jay:
What is the story of the video games?

Rich:
Just follow up on Gozer stuff. But I mean, the important thing though, is you get those characters and you get the witty banter. Game was more credible than Ghostbusters two.

Jay:
does Bill Murray sound in different in his voiceover?

Rich:
some people say he does I think he sounds like Peter Venkman I know got some two different to me, but they give Egon one litre at the end. he says we eat gods for breakfast.

Jay:
oh, we're coming up on your favourite scene Mike. 

Mike: 
What scenes is that? 

Jay:
Oh, you know what scene that is?

Mike:
Oh God, I tried to rewatch this movie a couple of times I don't think I ever got this far I don't think I like ever got to the Statue of Liberty Park really like since originally seen yeah Wow recall they had a Nintendo controller.

Jay:
Yeah.

Mike:
And walks down the street. The they use the torch to rehash.

Jay:
this is where I completely start hating the movie. 

Jay:
most of the movies-tired to rehash and then you get to this and this is just dumb.

Rich:
It's also a rehash though they wanted a chain thing walking down the street. 

Jay:Mike:
Sure. But this is just so stupid.

Mike:
Well yeah, I thought the goodwill angle was people singing outside.

Jay:
Is that hope it is? Yeah, you don't need the Statue of Liberty for that to happen.

Mike:
The Statue of Liberty was like brute force rehashing it but I guess the goodwill singing weaken the structure enough for the Statue of Liberty to hit. this is just an excuse to use these things.

Rich: 
Well, they got some toys Mike, they got to make toys.

Jay:
The slime has a different consistency here to it looks like silly string.

Mike:
Yeah, but can I just point out to the they only have four of these things that look like it holds maybe two gallons. 

Jay:
I could forgive that if I cared about any of what's happening in the scene on there's no joystick

Rich:
Here it is, the movie completely falls apart.

Jay:
They establish earlier, they play Happy music and but like why they play music here but they still have to use some sort of Nintendo joystick to control it.

Mike:
Just so that it can show that they know they could tell it where to go they could direct.

Rich: 
Otherwise, it would just hop around randomly.

Jay:
what is the Nintendo joystick?

Mike:
Circuit board on it.

Jay:Because Elon has made it. 

Rich:
why is it moving its legs? It could just be hopping like the toaster did.

Mike:
How would be more okay if they used bigos magical psychic powers to somehow make the thing move or you know, use some ghost logic as opposed to the physical scientific explanation.

Jay:
I had leftover footage from that other scene so they just threw it in there.

Rich:
I'd prefer they didn't do it at all. 

Mike:
Yeah, find some other, if they needed a big epic way to break into the jello. they should have done something different. 

Rich: 
Was Louis in the cartoon? 

Jay:
Yeah. 

Rich: 
He wasn't the cartoon.

Rich:
Only after this came out. So, it was like three episodes, because they tried to make the cartoon look a little bit more like Ghostbusters two, and then he never showed up again.

Jay:
Okay. Did he ever wear the Ghostbusters? 

Rich: 
I don't recall. I know. He's only in a handful episode. 

Jay:
okay.

Mike:
Yeah. Okay. So why does the robe move? Look around.

Jay:
Nothing about this makes any sense.

Mike:
The torch actually doesn't shoot fire out either. Don't think there's like propane and gas inside the torch. In real life.

Jay:
Yeah, there's a lot of things with Ghostbusters. You have to suspend your disbelief to a certain extent but this is just.

Mike:
I also think the second the Statue of Liberty stepped on a street. It would collapse into it. Because it's not solid ground. It does crash your car. 

Rich: 
But it should be like breaking down into the sewer system.

last 

Mike: 
Somebody slams into the ground. The weight of the statues, this is the worst, it's so illogical so cartoony.

Jay:
Yeah, I remember the cartoon making more sense than any of this. Typically, yes. The cartoon had little storylines, and nothing this unbelievable for this universe. It just goes over the edge and then Slimer shows up again because Slimer Oh, he's the bus driver. 

Mike: 
That makes sense that they had their little Interplay that you explain.

Rich: 
Like it's just completely fucking random. 

Mike:
He does run into him in the montage sequence and runs away.

Jay:
At least they didn't put Slimer in this more. Because I know the cartoon he lived at the firehouse, he's a regular character. Yeah, I think even at his own cartoon right for a while. That's when the cartoon started to get bad. The first two seasons are pretty dark. And then they decided it had to be all friendly.

Mike:
Yeah, so I see that the goodwill singing opened up a window right by the glass dome, did you just see that. 

Jay:
No, 

Mike:
Started to clear away.

Jay:
They're not singing yet. People are cheering and they're happy to see the Statue of Liberty but the singing comes a little bit later. The statue itself apparently is enough, I guess that gives them a little bit of goodwill and then they start singing and that's what really defeats Vigo. 

Rich: 
In Ghostbusters, plan is inherently flawed Isn't it because the Ghostbusters don't defeat Vigo the singing does. 

Jay:
While the thing weakens them and then they shoot at the them. 

Rich: 
and it makes them flee back into the painting yeah and so thing is still having enough power and he could do it.

Mike:
here's another parallelization that we lose totally character covered in something and or disoriented, little baby, that's positively charged.

Jay:
We get explain it somehow, just throw a line in, they can control whether the slime is positive or negative now, they stay establish that earlier I said this one the he got made love do it. 

Rich: 
Are they same? explained this.

Jay:
I think all these tanks of slime here. Egan had to fuck all those. And that's how they made it all positive. 

Rich: 
That's why it looks different. It's both slime and semen. 

Jay:
Okay, that makes sense. Oh, there's a deleted scene of Egon just fucking those tanks.

Mike:
These are different area and the place you can hide the baby. It's like a gigantic Museum.

Jay:
Yeah, go into the bathroom or something. And then he just appears. 

Rich: 
He doesn't need a baby.

Mike: 
No, he's out of sync with reality.

Jay:
I don't know how this actor didn't go on to a huge career after this movie. He's such a such a looker. It's not even going to be the next Brad Pitt. It's not even his voice. I usually didn't see that guy and one other movie. He's in John Carpenter's in the mouth of madness. He shows up and blows his head off of the shotgun. 

Rich: 
Does he say anything? 

Jay:
He does. He has a couple lines.

Mike:
This is when they got knocked down by Gozer.

Jay:
Yeah, that's just because they didn't want to act anymore. They're like, can we just lay here for the rest of the same.

Mike:
This is exactly what happened. Except they're not out on the edge of a building.

Jay:
But they don't even bother to get up for the rest of the scene. They're just going to lay there. Remember in the first one when Vigon said I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought, I love that line. Because like Dolph Lundgren here are, not Dolph Lundgren, he is lamb bear.

Mike: 
So fast Vigo.

Jay:
Bill Murray doesn't want to get up. He's done with this movie. Can I have napped until we're done with the scene?

Mike: 
They could aim their weapons, am I right?

Rich: 
Yeah, Well, they might hit the baby. Yeah, I guess they could shoot the baby with the slime cannon.

Mike:
Do you know they are goiong to drop the baby now? 

Jay:
No.

Mike: 
Weighing all these possibilities. Sigourney Weaver is tied up plastic tube.

Rich: 
Dropping the baby is better than Vigo overriding the baby soul, okay. how do we handle this movie?

Mike: 
This is funny here's 

Jay:
the this is the thing, that is now weakening him. 

Rich: 
you need to establish that everyone in New York is a jackass. 

Mike:
I think they're going on the assumption that everyone knows that already.

Jay:
Yeah, I know. But for the sake of the film. 


Jay:
Well, that's like I mentioned the new Robocop like we know that Detroit sucks but, in the movie, you have to establish that.

Mike:
What kind of a funny payoff when Bartley blasts off things?

Rich: 
I Hate it.

Mike: 
Something, you hate.

Jay:
even you could just not have a minute at all. Lewis totally has no purpose to be in this. 

Mike:
You could almost have not had anything in this mood. Once you take one thing out. You take the other thing out then the other thing and the whole thing falls apart.

Rich: 
Sure. Well, this movie should not have been made.

Mike: 
Someone made a whole bunch of money off this, Rich.

Jay:
This was a hit, right? Yeah, like I don't think anybody really remembers it fondly, but it did make a shitload of money you go to see just because it says Ghostbusters. Yeah, do you like this makeup on him here?

Mike: 
Yeah, the demon character looks cool.

Mike:
Winston's reaction was really good there. Mild fear. 

Jay:
So, they're shooting him with positively charged slime and they're shooting the painting with the proton packs. What is this doing? 

Rich: 
The seats evil, Jay. They're like lassos basically, I know lassos for ghosts. I mean, they could have come up with something clever, you know, like they could they could have thrown like turpentine on the painting. Oh, and that could have defeated Vigo. Yeah, that would have been mildly clever.

Mike: 
But that wouldn't involve them shooting their proton better.

Jay:
Yeah, you have to you have to have them shooting the proton packs, even if it doesn't make any sense. Just because they're Ghostbusters and that's what they do.

Rich: 
 Like destroying that painting that's like the obvious thing Yeah. 

Jay:
Now just shoot it. 

Rich:
It is the laziest fucking way they get an end to the shooting.

Rich: 
That's what they went with. Ray doesn't even get to do anything but be on the floor. I like Ray, dammit.

Mike:
I wish this movie had fun lines. This summer early on. 

Mike: 
It's going up hold up for hope that there was a fun line in this one.

Jay:
Now Ray is covered. They're both covered with the positively charged slime so they just say they love each other, even though, they don't know each other.

Mike:
Well, it's being drunk or whatever. He's high.

Jay:
Whatever. And then this doesn't make any sense. I know. It's supposed to be just like a gag but it's stupid. 

Mike:
Oh, this is beyond stupid. It's into cartoony realm.

Jay:
It's a fun painting by itself. It's amusing looking but this doesn't make any sense. 

Rich: 
Did Vigo paint that before?

Mike: 
A wink jokes. it's not to make any sense. And then they all climb down the stairs of a building.

Jay:
and the credits roll as everybody cheers. Come on, guys. 

Mike: 
We're going to be like Ghostbusterâ€™s sequel. Isn't this great? 

Rich: 
No. And it's over.

Jay:
Then we get our roll, call the credits? 

Mike: 
Yeah.

Mike:
Are there any cutscenes from this? I don't remember.

Jay:
some of this stuff is footage that wasn't in the rest of the movie and then it cuts to the scene you're talking about, Rich that shows a little bit of that.

Rich: 
Oh, we have the Statue of Liberty? 

Jay:
Yeah, like this wasn't in the movie. I miss Rick Maraniss, God bless him though for leaving Hollywood because he just didn't care to do movies anymore.

Rich: 
Jay, he owes you for more entertainment. they never wear those new uniforms outside of the Montage, do they? 

Jay:
This is like wrapping up his little subplot but they didn't care so they just cut it out of the movie. Not that it was a subplot but making him become a more obvious character.

Mike:
Some of these shots I'm assuming they shot for [crosstalk]

Rich:
There's another scene where they talk to the mayor before they go into the museum. 

Jay:
Another scene where they talk to the mayor Yeah, before they go to the museum. It's another cutscene. like outside the museum? 

Rich: 
Yeah. 

Jay:
Okay. What do they talk to him about? 

Rich: 
I haven't seen it but I know it existed at some point, okay.  given those grey uniforms like on the poster, and they never wear them.

Jay:
It is just an excuse to have more toys. 

Rich: 
But I don't think they ever made toys like that. 

Jay:
No. They made some weird ass Ghostbusters toys especially near the end. Sure. I remember there were ones that I had like a ray one where you squeeze his arm and like the top of his head pops up and his eyes stick out like they were coming up with toys. 

Rich: 
did any kids ever want those because the only ones I ever wanted were just the standard uniform. Ghostbusters. 

Mike: 
I agree. 

Jay:
Yeah, that seal I don't even remember. I think I must have got it as a president or something because I didn't have any of the weird ones. I didn't have very many Ghostbusters toys in general. I had a shitload of ninja turtle toys. I had the proton pack. That's all I wanted.

Mike: 
I had the regular toys in the car.

Jay:
Do either of you ever have the firehouse? 

Rich: 
Yeah, 

Mike: 
Yeah.

Jay:
You both have the firehouse? 

Mike:
Yeah, I think so. Or a friend of mine, had it.

Rich: 
I definitely had that. I had the act of one.

Mike: 
Yeah, I don't want the extra one did not fit in the firehouse. 

Rich: 
No. It fits through the doors, but like the back end would be like sitting way out behind the playset, I think. I could be misremembering. 

Jay:
was the firehouse like Castle Gray skull where it like hinges open? 

Mike:
Yeah, that would close, I didn't have the firehouse I remember. A friend of mine did.

Rich: 
I remember it had an action pole that the Ghostbusters platform and it was like spiral spin. 

Jay:
I never had any of these things. All I had was Ray. When you squeezed his arm, his eyes popped out. 

Mike: 
Jay had a part of a slinky. 

Jay:
That's Ghostbusters II. Why do people want Ghostbusters III? 

Rich: 
I mean, this movie is proof. Yeah, evidence that it should never happen. 

Jay:
Light lightning in a bottle. That first movie. Yeah, you can say that the concept works in different realms. But it really it was so many specific decisions made by these specific people that made that movie what it is. 

Mike:
Since a lot of people not getting it. You know?

Rich: 
See, I don't know, this is terrible. As much as it is just a letdown. It's definitely not good. 

Jay:
Yeah. 

Mike: 
Oh, right. 

Rich: 
You could do worse. 

Jay:
Oh, there's been plenty of worse sequels. But I don't know. This is almost worse in the sense that it's so uninspired. That's like, when something is in the middle of the road, it's almost worse than a complete disaster of a sequel because that's at least interesting in a certain way.
