Jay: Hey, Mike.
Jay: Did you hear Neill Blomkamp is making a big-budget Alien fan-film called Alien 5, starring Sigourney Weaver?
Mike: Really?
Mike: The director of District 9, District 9, and District 9 is making an Alien film?
Jay: That's right, Mike.
Jay: And apparently he's going to ignore Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection.
Mike: That's right, Jay.
Mike: If you don't like the way something turned out, or if it's not working the way you want it to, or if you're not getting the box office results you want, just change it, skip it, redo it, remake it, start over.
Mike: It doesn't matter.
Mike: Nobody remembers anything anymore, so who cares?
Jay: Well, none of that shit matters.
Jay: As long as it makes money overseas, who cares?
Mike: That's right.
Mike: The corporate market researchers recently discovered that the world's 1.35 billion Chinese people are mildly to moderately interested in a new Alien film.
Mike: And that only means one thing.
Jay: Money!
Mike: But we wouldn't get any of that money.
Jay: Why not?
Mike: Well, because, we--
Jay: So, because of this exciting Alien news, we've made a brand new commentary track.
Mike: That's right, Jay.
Mike: And we went right back to the beginning: Ripley Scott's 1979 film Alien.
Jay: But we also talked about all the other Alien films, too.
Jay: Because that first one is so boring.
Mike: So check out our store page, or you could follow the link below.
Jay: You'll also see all our other commentary tracks there as well.
Mike: Hey, Jay.
Mike: Is internet superstar Rich Evans in on this commentary track?
Mike: I don't remember.
Jay: Well, of course he is.
Jay: What else does he have to do?
