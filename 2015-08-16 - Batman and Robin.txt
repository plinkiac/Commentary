JAY:
Hello, and welcome to the Red Letter Media commentary track for...Batman and Robin.
Uh, I'm Jay.

MIKE:
I'm Mike.

RICH:
I'm Rich.

MIKE:
And this is a Joel Schumacher film.

JAY:
Oh, boy.
Is it ever.
And here we have Arnold Schwarzenegger getting top billing.
Which happened with, uh, Jack Nicholson in the first movie, too.
Because they're the same caliber of actor.

MIKE:
What would happen if they were both in a movie together?

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
See, this is shocking to me, because, you know, Arnold at this point, I mean, his star was kind of fading, right?
I mean, Terminator 2 was a few years before this.
A number of years before this.

JAY:
Yeah.
This was around the time of, like, Eraser.
And it was after Last Action Hero, which I don't think is a bad movie, but it was, like, a big bomb.
So, his star was fading, but i think he was still the biggest star in this movie.

RICH:
At the time, wasn't George Clooney a bigger star?
Because ER was hot shit.

JAY:
He, he was a big TV star.

MIKE:
He was a big TV star.

JAY:
But that's a different world.

RICH:
True.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Just ask, just ask Ray Romano.

JAY:
What are you talking about?
He had a, he had a great film career.
Remember Welcome to Mooseport?

MIKE:
That was a hit.

JAY:
So here we have butt.
Cock.
And that's butt.
Cock.
And that's how we're starting our Batman movie.

RICH:
You forgot nipples.
We gotta mention the nipples.
It's obligatory.

MIKE:
The famous nipples on the batsuit.

JAY:
The famous nipples on the batsuit.
That's the thing that everybody goes to when they talk about why this movie sucks.
And it's, like, that's the least of this movie's problems.

MIKE:
Right.
Right.
Joel, Joel Schumacher mentioned that in the commentary for Batman Forever.
He said nipples on the batsuit became an international thing.
Like, and he said,
"Everyone needs to get a life."
And he's right, you know?

JAY:
To a certain extent, he's right.

RICH:
Can we, can we defend Joel Schumacher for a little bit, because I know, I know...

JAY:
You can.

RICH:
He's capable of good movies.
He did Falling Down.
He did, uh, Lost Boys.
I love The Lost Boys.
I mean, is, is this movie really just kind of a studio monster, where they wanted campy, child-friendly Batman?

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
It's, well, it's, I think, I think they're equal to blame.

MIKE:
No.
I mean, Joel Schumacher to me, like Rich said, he's made a lot of good films.
A lot of varying films.
Like Falling D-...
Compare Falling Down to this.

JAY:
Oh, sure.
8mm, did anyone see that?

MIKE:
Yep.

JAY:
With Nicholas Cage.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That's a pretty dark film.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've seen that.
That was him?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That scene where he's burning the giant pile of child porn is, is very similar to the scene where George Clooney slides down the back of a dinosaur.
They're just, they're cinematic equivalents.

RICH:
See, the tragedy is, when you think of Joel Schumacher now, you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger dressed like Mr. Freeze making ice puns.

JAY:
Yes.
And you think of nipples on the batsuit.

RICH:
Yes.
And you think of neon.

JAY:
That's, that's, when everyone talks about Joel Schumacher, that's what they go to.

MIKE:
Yeah.
But he's just a, he's just a working man's director.
He's, he's just a guy who tells stories on the screen.

JAY:
I think he's kind of like a Brett Ratner-type, where he's just sort of a studio Yes Man.
He's had some better scripts to work with.
Like, some, like, ÃŒ'm not a big fan of The Lost Boys, but I know a lot of people really like it.
I think a lot of that is due to the story, but...

MIKE:
Uh-oh.

JAY:
I don't know.

MIKE:
Al better cancel the pizzas.
He looks like he's having horrible gas.
"Oh, cancel the pizzas..."
Anyways.
Oh, this is very 1960's.

JAY:
Oh, god.
This, yeah.
Why is Commissioner Gordon in, like a, like, a street cop uniform now?
Did he get demoted between movies?

MIKE:
No, that's...
He's got fucking four stars on his shoulder.

JAY:
But he never...
He just wore, like, a suit and tie in all the other movies.
He never had to wear any sort of uniform.

MIKE:
That's his dress uniform.
It's a police commissioner dress uniform.
Quit complaining about that.

RICH:
You've got, you've gotta recognize him as cop, because how often do we see Gordon in these movies?

JAY:
That's true.
He's, he's practically an extra in this movie.

MIKE:
Rich, the most, most of the audience is here to see Pat Hingle, okay?
Not Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone, or Uma Thurman.
They're here to see Pat Hingle, goddammit.
He's a fucking star.
Uh, so here's Arnold, uh, turning people into plasticine wax.
I mean ice.
I mean ice.

JAY:
I know there's a part towards the end of the movie where there's one giant ice skull, and you can see it, like, wobbling.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because it's rubber.
Yeah.
Arnold is, is terrible in this movie.
He's not a great actor to begin with, but he's...
I mean, everybody in this movie should be embarrassed.
But he's particularly bad.

RICH:
Well, I mean, what else do you do with this material?

JAY:
Well, that's the thing.
And we can talk about this when Uma Thurman comes up later.
But she seems to be going for it.
As far as the, the campy over-the-top acting, she seems to get that, and get that this is all a joke.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
But everyone else just seems kind of confused.
They're just sort of acting normal.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And George Clooney is not acting at all.
He's just being George Clooney, even when he's Batman.
Like, when he jumps down here, and he says,
"Hi, Freeze."
"I'm Batman."
Like, he doesn't even try to say it in any kind of threatening way.

MIKE:
It's tongue-in-cheek.
Yeah.

JAY:
And then he...
It's not even tongue-in-cheek, though.
He just kind of says it.

MIKE:
"Duh-duh, duh-duh...Wilma!"

RICH:
See, George, George Clooney is acting like this is near the end of his career, where he just doesn't care.
But this is, this is when he was a rising star.
Yet here he is, huge movie, phoning it in.
How weird is that?

MIKE:
I don't know if he's phoning it in.

JAY:
I, I think it's more that he just didn't know what he was supposed to do.

RICH:
He's supposed to be Bruce Wayne.
He's acting like George Clooney.

JAY:
Yeah.
No.
He's supposed to be Batman here, and he's acting like George Clooney.
Bruce Wayne...
George, George Clooney acting like George Clooney when he's Bruce Wayne in this movie...fine.
Like, this movie sucks, and there's no sort of dark element.
Or, or tortured soul element to, to Batman.
So if they just wanna have him play, like, generic playboy man, fine.
But at least have some distinction between that and Batman.

MIKE:
I'm find with his performance in this.
Because...nothing matters in this.
Like, there is nothing that's, that's of any consequence.
Like, this scene is totally out of the 1960's Batman.
Like, wh-, wh-...
I can just see some studio person going,
"What is Mr. Freeze's, uh..."
"He's gotta have, uh, uh, henchman."
"What are they..."
"Hockey players."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Because cold."
And, like, uh...

JAY:
"Because cold."

MIKE:
Where do these people come from?
There's, no, you know...

JAY:
Yeah.
He did that in the last...
They did that in the last Batman movie, too, where everyone just has henchman, and why?
They tried to give some sort of motivation for it in the, the Tim Burton ones.
Like, why these characters would have, you know...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
People that would help 'em out, or why they'd have henchman.
But here, it's, nothing matters.

RICH:
My, my theory is that some, some executive that was only familiar with the, the 60's Batman, and grew up with Adam West and was just confused by the Burton movie...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And he,
"Why isn't Batman camp?"
"Where's the ka-pow sound effect?"

JAY:
Was it George Lucas?
Was he in charge of this movie?

RICH:
Yeah.
It was George Lucas.

JAY:
Okay.

RICH:
"Where's, where's the ka-pow sound effect?"
"Robin's a funnier character than we've ever had before."

JAY:
Yeah.
That's sort of confusing, though.
The idea that a studio executive would be like that because, generally, it's, like, movie's a big hit, we want to replicate that exactly.
And the Tim Burton movies are, are dark.
Are darker, anyway.
In, in comparison to the Nolan ones, they're not.
For the time.
So how do you go from that to this?

MIKE:
To, to be fair, Batman, 1989 Batman was a huge hit.
Great movie.
Batman, uh, Returns was not so well-received.
It was a little muddled.
I remember...

JAY:
It did well, but I don't think it was...

MIKE:
It did well, but it was definitely a downward dip...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
For Tim Burton, because I remember seeing that, and it was like,
"Oh, you know, Catwoman's in it."
"Um, the Penguin."
"Neat."
You know?
And then I watched it and I remember, like, feeling, like, two villains is too much.
It's too muddled.
It got...
I, I don't even remember anything about it, really.

JAY:
Oh.
See, I liked Batman Returns.
It doesn't...
It's not a good Batman movie, but then again, I don't think we've ever had a good Batman movie.
We've just had good movies that Batman happens to be in.

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
Um...

MIKE:
So it, it's almost like, like they wanted to take it in a different direction, and why not go...

JAY:
Yeah.
You can see...
I mean, I rewatched Batman Forever probably since the theater, uh, in preparation for doing this commentary.
And it's almsot as bad as this.
I didn't remember it being quite that bad.
But it still retains a little bit...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Of the elements from the Tim Burton ones.
A little bit.
There's still Bruce Wayne's kind of tortured.
Um...

RICH:
There was the wobbling.
There was the wobbling icicle.

JAY:
Oh.
There was one wobbling icicle.
There's more.

MIKE:
The, the...

JAY:
We're not done yet.

MIKE:
The wire work in this movie is just atrocious, by the way.

JAY:
But, Mike, it's a comic book.

MIKE:
Oh, it's a comic book.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's an infuriating thing that Joel Schumacher would constantly say in his commentary tracks.
He doesn't seem to understand the difference between a movie and a comic book.

JAY:
He's not saying it's a comic book movie.

MIKE:
Right.
He says,
"Tommy Lee, this is Tommy Lee Jones' first comic book."
And you're like,
"What?"
He, he also said something, like, uh, he's like,
"This, there's a little bit of, there's, uh, more characterization and depth to these characters than there, there is in a comic book."

JAY:
Oh, my god.
He said that about these movies?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's, like, I, obviously Joel Schumacher does not read comic books or have any i-, any understanding of the source material or anything.
Um, or respect, I should say.
Not that you should.
But, because like Rich says, comic books are made for four-year olds.
Right, Rich?

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
I say that all the time.

MIKE:
Well, give us a little b-...
Oh, my god.
This suddenly became an Austin Powers film.

JAY:
Yeah.
This is very much like the Dr. Evil's escape pod or something.

RICH:
And what, what backstory do you want?
I mean, there's not much relevant.
I mean, you could, you could argue that this is a, a throwback to, like, 50's, 40's-era Batman with Robin that was a bit sillier.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
But I think, I think at this time, uh, the fans were enamored with, like, The Dark Knight Returns.
80's, 80's Batman, when Batman started to get dark.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And, and, a, a return to camp was not at all welcomed by, uh, anybody in the comic book community at that point in time.

JAY:
Well, I don't think he was welcomed by anybody, because this movie didn't do well.
I think people went to Batman Forever because the first two were popular.
And you're like,
"Okay, we'll see this new one."
Uh, Jim Carrey's in it.

JAY:
And he was...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
The hot ticket at the time.
And then you get to this one, and it's just taking the worst elements of Batman Forever, and just amping 'em up.

MIKE:
Well, it, it, they went with a diff-, a slightly different direction with Batman Forever.
A little more goofy.
I, I hate Tommy Lee Jones in that movie.

JAY:
Yes.
That's the worst, probably, villain performance in any comic book movie.

MIKE:
In any movie.

JAY:
And I like Tommy Lee Jones.
He's a great actor.
But, man.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Worse than George Clooney in this?
I mean, they're not even trying.
Not even trying.

JAY:
Ugh...

MIKE:
Well, Tommy Lee Jones is trying too hard, and he has no idea what he's doing.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Jim Carrey, you give him the whacky psychopath role, he does fine.
Uh, he's over-the-top, but, you know.
That's Jim Carrey.
They needed, they needed Two-Face to be, like, more sinister.

JAY:
A contrast to that?

MIKE:
Yeah.
More sinister.
More stoic.
More strange.
But instead, he's, like, he's, like, laughing hysterically.
It's, it's just awful.
But Joel Schumacher makes Batman Forever.
And like you said, Jay, people go to see it.
"It's the third Batman movie."
"There's a new Batman."
"Neat."

JAY:
I, I think it was the highest-grossing of any of these.

MIKE:
Oh, sure.

JAY:
I think.

RICH:
Really?

JAY:
I think so.
I could be wrong.
Maybe not more than the first Batman.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But I'm not positive.

MIKE:
It's, it's setting the stage for disaster because the success gave Joel Schumacher and the producer, I forget his name on this, like, carte blanche to just go hog wild.

JAY:
Yes.
Well, also work in elements of the movie that are specifically there just to sell toys.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
There, there's an element of that, too, where it's like,
"Oh, now they're, they're on surfboards flying through the sky."
"We can make a toy of that."
You know?

MIKE:
I don't remember too many toys from this.
Were there a lot?

JAY:
I, apparently there was.
Because that was...
Joel Schumacher is very candid about saying that, too.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
How they would come up to him and say,
"Here's toys."
"Work these into the movie."
"And then we're gonna sell the shit out of them."

RICH:
How does Mr. Freeze have butterfly wings?

JAY:
Because he was anticipating this happening, Rich.
You gotta be prepared.
Everybody is prepared for everything all the time in these movies.

RICH:
He was anticipating having to leave the museum in a rocket ship?
And that the rocket ship would, would explode midair, and he'd have to jump out with butterfly wings?

MIKE:
Hey, for some reason, Batman and Robin both had ice, uh, blades built into their shoes.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And at the end of...
Well, that's a different movie, but I was gonna say, at the end of, uh, Batman Forever, Batman just happened to bring along 100 coins that are similar to...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
That he just throws up in the air.

MIKE:
"I have these!"

JAY:
Where was he storing those?

MIKE:
In his buttcrack.
That's why they kept sh-, that's why they show his butt in the beginning.
It was foreshadowing.

JAY:
Oh.
It was foreshadowing.
Okay.

RICH:
That's, that's at least more acceptable because Batman would know Two-Face's little...

MIKE:
Oh, shut up!

RICH:
Thing with the coin.
And you could...
That, that's something that he could logically prepare for.

JAY:
That's true.

RICH:
To confuse him.
That makes some sense.
You can anticipate that.
You can't anticipate needing ice skates at a museum robbery when you don't know who Mr. Freeze is before this.

MIKE:
That's true.
That's true.

JAY:
That's true.
Yeah.
They don't know Mr. Freeze at this point, right?
He's not, like, a known villain...

MIKE:
Nope.

JAY:
In this movie yet.

RICH:
I don't think so.

JAY:
Or in this world.

MIKE:
Nope.
Commissioner Gordon tells him about it on the way.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Maybe Batman just really likes ice skating.
He just has it built in for his own recreational purporses.

MIKE:
That's possible.
Yeah.

RICH:
You know, between, between crimes, you gotta do something.
I mean, there's not, there's not a supervillain robbing a bank every night.
There's some nights where you're just walking around waiting for someone to get mugged, and it just doesn't happen.
Just, yeah.
Just go over to the lake, and start skating.

MIKE:
That's true.
Now where are they?
Is this his lair?

JAY:
No.
They went down...
They explained it...

MIKE:
Oh.
He fr-, froze it.

JAY:
In a bad bit of ADR.

MIKE:
It's, like, the sewer.

JAY:
Yeah.
Something like that.

MIKE:
He's freezing the pipes, or something, and, uh...
Oh, my god.

JAY:
"The day is mine," he says.

MIKE:
"I'll kill you next time."

JAY:
Yeah.
They gave Mr. Freeze the worst dialogue in this movie.

MIKE:
Uh, just him?

JAY:
The first...
Well, I mean, he gets all the ice puns.
But also, like, at the beginning of the movie, he says,
"Kill the heroes."

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And I remember that really bothering me.
Because it's, like, it cements the fact that this Batman franchise is now aimed at six-year olds.

RICH:
Can you imagine how dull it would be to be a superhero?
Like, 99.9% of the time.
Because, because it's not like you walk down the street, there's always a mugging.
I mean, you're gonna go, like, like, months between stumbling onto a crime.

JAY:
Apparently, not in this universe.

RICH:
No, not in this universe.

JAY:
There's always things happening.

MIKE:
See, that, that...
Can we talk about supervillains and Batman?
Like, okay.
Batman has no superpowers, per se.
He, he's a wealthy guy with lots of toys and gadgets.
I like Batman if he's foiling regular criminals.
I don't like any of the villains in Batman.
They're all too whacky for me.
Do you know what I'm saying?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And that's what I always, like, when you, when you're saying a, a supervillain, or a superhero would be bored, I always think Spider-Man would be bored.
Because Spider-Man has a legit superpower.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
But then, conveniently, there's always, like, a supervillain that just kind of creates himself.
That's, you know, that's...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's, comes out of nowhere.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's one thing I really liked about the X-Men movies, is they never had that villain of the week mentality.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Where it's, like, every movie has to introduce at least one new villain.

MIKE:
That's true.

JAY:
Those are, those are more about, like, a power struggle between, you know, the difference, uh...

RICH:
Talents.

JAY:
Mentalities of, yeah.
Of what, you know, how people feel about their mutant powers.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Or, yeah, people with superpowers fighting other people with superpowers.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Which is a different brand.

JAY:
Yeah.
Where it's, like, a moral dilemma.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
And this is, this is villain of the week.
And that really started with Batman, uh, uh, Returns.

JAY:
That's the interesting thing, is it started with Batman Returns.
We had the Penguin and Catwoman.
And it's continued to this day.

RICH:
You can do Batman well without supervillains, too.
Like, uh, Year One does that.

JAY:
Not in the movie form.
No one will accept it.
You have to have...

RICH:
Probably, probably not.

JAY:
You have to have some sort of crazy villain.

MIKE:
Well, because that's the marketing, uh, element of it is,
"So-and-so..."
"Danny DeVito's playing the Penguin!"

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Oh, Danny DeVito's the Penguin!"
"That's great!"
"Uma Thurman is, uh, Poison Ivy."
It's just, like, you need that.
You can't just have Batman, dark Batman story.

RICH:
The early episodes of Batman: The Animated Series, there were episodes where he just flatout just fought mobsters.

JAY:
Yeah?

RICH:
Yeah.
Then, then, then the executives were like,
"We want, we want supervillains."

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It should always just be the Joker.

RICH:
That's, that's...

JAY:
That's why they keep coming back to the Joker.

RICH:
That's kind of Batman's major flaw.
It...
The Joker is just too good a villain that any, anything less than the Joker is a letdown.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, I don't know about that.

JAY:
I mean, we are about to get Bane.

RICH:
That's not Bane.

JAY:
But that's Bane.
This is Tom Hardy's first, uh, time playing Bane.

RICH:
This is monster man who also happens to be wearing a mask.

MIKE:
Those, those props are terrible.

JAY:
Yeah.
This is such a bizarre movie because it, it simultaneously looks super expensive and super cheap.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean...

JAY:
This movie, it's barely a movie.
It's like watching money burn on screen.

MIKE:
They, they did not put a lot of budget into the science lab.
This is just, like, cheap tubes from, uh, a hardware store.

JAY:
Well, what more do you need?
They're doing science experiments.
You use tubes.

MIKE:
The comical, like, flasks with the colored liquid in them.
You know.
It's just terrible.

JAY:
Well, here we have John Glover as the mad scientist man.
Who is, of course, Daniel Clamp in Gremlins 2.

MIKE:
He looks really bad.

JAY:
Oh.
I think that's how they made him up for the movie.

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
Yeah.
He, he looked much worse before that.

MIKE:
Duh-duh, duh-duh, duh, duh, bum.
Why does he...
Oh.
He creates Bane to sell him to world governments as a super soldier.

JAY:
Yes.
And Uma Thurman just happens to wander in at the exact moment.

MIKE:
They happen to work in the same lab.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's...

JAY:
Well, she was in the other room, and she was conveniently, uh, talking into a tape recorder that explains all of her motivation and what's happening.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That's kind of a theme in this whole movie.
If you're a fan of movies where characters talk out loud to themselves about exactly wh-, how they're feeling...

MIKE:
Well, she's gotta explain all of her experiments into her tape recorder in case she forgets.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
This is a prequel to Still Alice.

JAY:
Still Ivy?

MIKE:
Still Ivy.
And no matter what happens, if you fall into a vat of, of freezing cryogenic liquid that would just kill you instantly, you just become a supervillain.
Because if horrible chemicals pour all over you, you just become a supervillain.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
It's real easy to become a supervillain.

RICH:
There was, there was an Onion article that was like an obituary for Peter Parker, a, a, a high school kid who died of cancer.

MIKE:
Because he was bit by a...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Radioactive spider.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
Uma Thurman really is the only one that kind of comes out of this movie unscathed because she knows exactly what it is.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And what was she...
This was '97.
So this is post-Pulp Fiction.

MIKE:
Yep.

JAY:
So she's somewhat well-known at this point.

MIKE:
Oh, no.

JAY:
Uh-oh.

RICH:
Was she ever huge?

JAY:
Ehh.
Maybe Kill Bill would be the closest.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
God, yeah.
Fuck, yeah.
I completely blanked on Kill Bill.

JAY:
I mean, she's never been, like, uh...
Oh, god.
I don't know.
Who's a big female star?

RICH:
Kathleen Turner?

JAY:
Oh, my god.
How old are you?

MIKE:
Now she's a big female star.

JAY:
Kathleen Turner, you mean?

RICH:
Ba-dum, dum.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She looks pretty rough.

JAY:
So, so the chemicals are strong enough to burn a hole in the ground, I guess, right?
But they just give her superpowers.

RICH:
They only melt concrete.

MIKE:
They, well, they give her magical pheromone dust power.

JAY:
Okay.
That, that makes sense.

MIKE:
Oh, he's thawing him out.
Oh...
Yes.
So here's Mr. Freeze's backstory.

JAY:
The security cameras in his, uh, lab, uh, look like cinematic, but...

MIKE:
There's someone filming there.

JAY:
I wonder if that was, like, uh, like, uh, a scene.
An actual scene in the movie.
Like, maybe it was the opening or something.

MIKE:
Oh, possibly.

JAY:
And then they just reused it, repurposed it for this.

MIKE:
So there he falls into a tank.
There's just, there's just an explosion for no reason.
Okay, that liquid is 50-below.
But somehow he survived.
Uh...

JAY:
And that's our explanation.

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
"But he survived somehow."

MIKE:
So he has to remain, um, at zero degrees...
Oh, no!

JAY:
Ugh...
It's all just so embarrassing.
Look at these graphics.

MIKE:
I just wonder, uh, how superheroes, like, or supervillains, what, what he, what his process was out of he got out of that tank, you know?
And he's gotta get his wife there.
I'm sure the police showed up.
And emergency people.
Then he's gotta build his lair, and get all...

JAY:
He's gotta build that suit.

MIKE:
He's gotta make the suit.
Where does he get the money from?
That's one thing about Spider-Man 2 I enjoyed, was that Doc Oc, like, he went around and stole money from a bank...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
From banks and set up a lab in, in, like, a rundown dock, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He didn't just magically have, like, a secret laboratory with all this technology for no reason.

JAY:
Yeah.
Well, and that's the difference because...

MIKE:
At least they tried.

JAY:
There, there are some people that don't like the Raimi Spider-Man movies because they think they're too campy.
But it's, like, they find, I think, a good balance, you know?
Because the, the, going too far with camp, you end up with this.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And it's just the worst.

MIKE:
It's good entertainment for, for little kids, I guess, right?

JAY:
What?
This movie?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
I guess.
I mean, they can kind of follow what's going on.
There's too many subplots in this movie, though, where, that just get lost.
I remember rewatching this, you know, in preparation for this commentary, and Alicia Silverstone is introduced, and then she disappears for 40 minutes.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And she comes back, and you're like,
"Oh, that's right."
"She's in this."

MIKE:
That, that was the big...
I mean, not that that was the only thing that was wrong with this movie.
But squeezing in Batgirl was just stupid and pointless.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's, like, um, the movie's called Batman and Robin.
Like, just focus on them.
You don't need Batgirl in this.
It's just so dumb.

JAY:
But then you can make another action figure.

RICH:
It's...
Yeah.
Exactly.
It's another action figure thing.

JAY:
And that's, that's the goal of this movie.
It's not tell a, a competent, exciting Batman and Robin story.
It's just to sell toys.

RICH:
Did they ever make an Alfred action figure?

JAY:
I hope so, because I would feel very bad, uh, for the actor that plays Alfred if they didn't.

MIKE:
What's his name?

JAY:
His, his name is Michael Gouch, I think?

MIKE:
No.
I think it's pronounced Michael "Go".

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But now he's Michael "Gone".
Because he's dead.

JAY:
Wow.
That was good timing on that joke, just as he disappears.

MIKE:
Yep.
And watch Chris O'Donnel's career disappear in the next scene.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's something to point out, is, is, starting with Batman Forever, and it definitely continues with this, where they're not casting people that are right for the roles.
They're just casting who's super big at the time.

RICH:
Is, is the amazing thing about this movie, how many people's careers survived?

JAY:
That's true.
That's true.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Everybody...

RICH:
It didn't kill George Clooney, which is kind of amazing.

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, he was in Dusk Till Dawn, but this was his big thing.
And, yeah.
This is the kind of thing that could kill a career.
But I think it's just the, the charisma of George Clooney preservered.

RICH:
"I just like him so much."
"It doesn't matter."
"Put him in something else."

JAY:
What did he do after this to kind of redeem himself?

RICH:
Three Kings?

MIKE:
Ocean's Eleven?

RICH:
Ooh, yeah.

MIKE:
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure my George Clooney-ology.

RICH:
Yeah.
Three Kings is a bit later.
It was 2000?

JAY:
That was shortly after this.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
Let me see.

RICH:
That was, that was 2004 or something, maybe.
Yeah.
I'm completely wrong.
Forget me.

MIKE:
I don't remember anything past yesterday.
I'm sorry.
So, anyway...

JAY:
Oh.
He did The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman right after this.

MIKE:
Oh, god.

JAY:
But, then he did Out of Sight, the Steven Soderbergh movie.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Which is a good movie.
And then Three Kings.
So...
So he bounced back by not doing anymore big budget schlock right after this.
Just making quality movies by real filmmakers.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Clooney, Clooney's a good actor.
He's charismatic.
He's likeable.
He's got that kind of, that charm to him.
Like, I saw some interviews with him about this movie.
And he's, he's very tongue-in-cheek and candid.

JAY:
Self-deprecating.

MIKE:
A little self-dep...
Yeah.

JAY:
He knows, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He's not doing the, like,
"This movie's gonna be a really great adventure story."
He doesn't care.

JAY:
Oh.
Are you talking about interviews from the time?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
From the time.
Still, he, he's...

JAY:
I thought you were gonna say, like, in retrospect, of course he would talk shit about 'em, but...

MIKE:
No.
He wasn't negative.
But he was more just like,
"Ehh..."

JAY:
He was just whatever?

RICH:
He didn't quite pull a Josh Trank?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Or the one I always think of is Dennis Miller.
I saw him on The Tonight Show to promote, uh, The Tales from the Crypt movie, Bordello of Blood.
And this was, like, days before it was opening.
And he was flat out saying it's garbage and don't go see it.
It was like,
"That's amazing."
Okay.
So, here, uh, Poison Ivy, she finds this beaker or whatever that has Wayne Enterprises on it.
And that's her entire motivation.
Just on a whim, she happened to notice that logo.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And that's her entire motivation for becoming a villain for the rest of the movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Like, what if she didn't notice that logo?
What would she be doing right now?

RICH:
Well, she's crazy now.

MIKE:
Well, it is revealed that Wayne Enterprises is funding her, their whole laboratory.
But I, I don't know if she knows that.

JAY:
She just sees that beaker and is like,
"Oh, I guess that's who's responsible."

MIKE:
It's, like, I dunno.
Does she show up at the Pyrex, uh, uh, world headquarters?
You know what I mean?

RICH:
Who would wanna be Mr. Freeze's henchman?
How do you...

JAY:
It looks, it looks pretty miserable.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Makes you sing.

RICH:
It's, like, that's another thing that always confused me.
How does the Joker ever get henchman?
I mean, he, he goes around killing people with, like, gas.
There's no profit in that.

JAY:
It's explained in the first movie.
It's, it's Jack Palance's people, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
And then he kills Jack Palance or whatever, and kind of takes over.

MIKE:
In the Nolan ones, it's, like, mentally, mental patients, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's kind of a stretch there.
Finding a lot of mental patients who just happened to be willing to go along with him.
That's a lot of mental patients.

MIKE:
I, I guess.

JAY:
At least it's something.
Here, it's like,
"Who are these guys?"

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
"Why would they follow him?"

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
So, like, very...

JAY:
And that was...
Oh, that was just Vivica A. Fox who showed up for five seconds for no reason.
Who was also, uh, a co-star of Uma Thurman's in Kill Bill.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.

JAY:
And later in this movie, Jesse Ventura shows up.
Did you even notice him when you rewatched it?

MIKE:
No.
No.

JAY:
Well, he plays a prison guard.
And so it's a little Predator reunion.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
And then at the end of the movie, the Predator shows up.

MIKE:
I was just gonna ask that, is the Predator in this?

RICH:
You know they did a comic book, Batman Versus Predator?

JAY:
Really?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
What haven't they done a versus to in comic books?

RICH:
Licenses.

JAY:
Didn't they do something with Archie?
Like, Archie and something weird.

RICH:
They've done, they've done a couple weird Archie ones.
They did Archie Meets the Punisher.

JAY:
Does he violently murder Jughead?

RICH:
He's, he's trying...
No.
He mistakes Archie for, like, a criminal.
Because Archie looks just like this mobster that the Punisher is trying to kill.
I haven't read it, but I know it's the Punisher trying to kill Archie.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
That needs to be a feature film.

JAY:
So Mr. Freeze's wife is played by Vendela.
Do you guys remember Vendela?

MIKE:
Uh, no.

JAY:
She was a big model at the time.
I think it was a Sports Illustrated thing.
But they cast her in this.
They cast, uh...

MIKE:
Elle McPherson.

JAY:
Elle McPherson.
So just whoever was, was a popular supermodel at the time, throw 'em in the movie.

RICH:
The, the tragedy is that at the time...
See, I mean, Mr. Freeze is originally just, almost just, just a complete schlock character.
Just a freeze gimmick guy.
But around this time, before this movie, they were turning him into, like, a soulful, tragic character.

JAY:
Oh, okay.

RICH:
And then they cast Arnold Schwarzenegger throwing out ice puns.

JAY:
I, I'm gonna...
He's a pretty soulful, tragic character in this movie, Rich.
I mean, his wife is frozen.
That's pretty sad.

MIKE:
Uh-oh.
Alfred was in the bathroom.

JAY:
That, those pizzas again.

MIKE:
Should've cancelled those pizzas.
"Sorry, Master Wayne."
"I was taking a dump."

JAY:
Here we have the best performance in the movie.
Uh, Alicia Silverstone.
Just a great, great actress.

MIKE:
Oh, oh, yeah.
She's brilliant.
She's, she's one for the ages.
She's...

JAY:
She looks like she's had a stroke.

MIKE:
Oh...

JAY:
Her mouth is...

MIKE:
Oh, my...

RICH:
Would you say she's "clueless"?

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Oh, I was wondering when that was gonna happen.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Yeah.
But that's a case of, they didn't cast...
I mean, first of all, Batgirl shouldn't be in this movie.
But they didn't cast, like, anyone that would be right...
They just cast her because she was super huge at the time.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
That was the formula.

JAY:
Chris O'Donnell was big at the time.
Uh...

MIKE:
It's a demographic thing.

JAY:
Yeah.
Exactly.

MIKE:
"I don't wanna see that."
"I'm a 14-year old girl."
"I don't wanna watch Batman and Robin."
"Oh, the Clueless girl's in it?"

JAY:
That's the most accurate impression of a teenage girl I've ever heard.

MIKE:
Thanks.

RICH:
Well, the formula was just cast the hottest actors...

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
And throw 'em in the movie.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
And the movie will make money.

JAY:
It's, it's products.
This is, this is not a movie anymore.
This is product.

MIKE:
There's a touching story about family...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And...

JAY:
I wanted to mention that, too.
That's a weird thing that they decided that that's what this, the theme of this movie would be, is family.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Why?

MIKE:
Because that's what Batman's all about.

RICH:
Because there's so many fucking characters.
What else do you do?

JAY:
I guess.

MIKE:
And I think Michael Gough was like,
"I want to be done with this crap."

JAY:
"Kill me."
"Kill me please."

MIKE:
There's a little bit where he's trying to locate his, his, um, his brother?

JAY:
Wilfred!

MIKE:
Wilfred?
Yeah.

JAY:
His brother's name is Wilfred.

MIKE:
So they could replace Alfred with Wilfred.
But the, but the funky thing is, um...
I mean, spoilers if you haven't seen this movie.
Um, Alfred has some kind of disease.
McGregor's Syndrome...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or some shit like that.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's what it's called.

MIKE:
And it's the same thing that Arnold, Arnold's wife has.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Who's floating in the tank.
And Arnold found the cure for Stage 1 McGregor's Syndrome.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
And so Alfred's, like, in, on his deathbed, and he's, like, 140-years old.
And then at the end of the film, they use, uh, Mr. Freeze's research to save, uh, Alfred.
It's like,
"I thought you were planning to kill him off so that you could replace him."
"Oh, you've, you've cured him so he could live for another week."
"And then die of old age."
"Good job, Batman."

JAY:
It's the closest thing this movie has to any sort of emotional element is,
"Oh, Alfred might die."

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then he doesn't.

JAY:
And then he doesn't.

MIKE:
"I'm back, sir."
"Oh..."

JAY:
Correct me if I'm wrong -- I don't remember exactly -- but this entire scene here, like, they're trying to have a little touching scene between the two of 'em.
But isn't the entre point of this scene just that she realizes that Alfred's...
Is that his wife in that picture?

MIKE:
Yeah.
I think so.

JAY:
Uh, yeah.
Or, or Wilfred's wife, or something.

MIKE:
I think that's her aunt.

JAY:
But her nickname is Peg.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Or, or short name is Peg.
And that's what the password is later in the movie for Alicia Silverstone to hack into his computer...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
And discover all the Batman shit.
That's pretty much the only...

MIKE:
Where she discovers his treasure trove of porno.

JAY:
Yeah.
But that's pretty much the only point of this scene, right?

MIKE:
Well...

MIKE:
Well, and to show that they're, they're very awkwardly close to each other in a very strange, sexual way.

JAY:
I was gonna, I was gonna say....
You were talking, so I didn't want to interrupt you.
But at the beginning of that scene, we were watching this with subtitles, and she came in and s-, the subtitles said,
"I came to tuck you in."
But I just glanced at it, and I thought it said something else for a minute.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
"Uncle Alfred, I came to fuck you."

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
Alfred puts the "butt" in "butler".
You know?
So here, Alicia Silverstone, -stein, Silverstone...
Whatever the fuck her name is.
She, even though she could've walked out the front door, she makes...
Because she's a person of free will and not a prisoner...

JAY:
It's, it's trying to give her some sort of characteristic.
She's gonna steal the...

MIKE:
"Oh, Alfred."
"I'm gonna go to the store."
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You didn't have to make an, uh, uh, uh, an escape rope.

JAY:
From a giant fucking mansion that it's possible no one would've seen you leave anyway.

MIKE:
Hey, is this a backlot?
An-, anyways.
Oh, so this gives her, her, uh, her superhero cred.

JAY:
Yeah.
Now she disappears from the movie for, like, 30 minutes.

MIKE:
Yeah.
She goes and she, she has a death wish, uh, by riding a motorcycle around at night.

JAY:
And now, even though no one has any clue who Poison Ivy is, she has to put on a disguise.
And Bane is also wearing a disguise.

MIKE:
Because, yeah.
His face doesn't give it away.
Oh, but he has a hat on.

JAY:
He has a hat on.
And a trenchcoat.
Rich, is that an accurate representation of the comic book Bane?

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Ear-, earlier on, they, uh, in, in the scene, she goes,
"Bane, get your plane tickets ready."
"We're, you know, we gotta get on a plane."
And I just pictured them going through the airport with them looking like that.

JAY:
Well, he's wearing the hat.

MIKE:
But...
No, no, no.
Later on, they, they have, uh, a surveillance photo.
And they took a charter plane.
Like, a little tiny four-seater plane.

JAY:
Oh, that's right.
And there's a weird bad photoshop.

MIKE:
It's a bad photoshop thing of them walking off the tarmac.
Like, he's got a hat on and a trenchcoat.
And this, just, face.

RICH:
At, at the time, I think the thing that pissed me off the most about this movie was the portrayal of Bane.

MIKE:
Really?

RICH:
Yeah.
Well, everything, everything pissed me off about this movie.
I'm just saying.

JAY:
That, that was it?

RICH:
The thing that pissed me off the most...

JAY:
Did you see this in theaters, Rich?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
You did?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh, wow.
Even I, I was done by this point.
And I was the biggest fan of that first movie when I was a little kid.
I thought it was the greatest thing ever.
But after Batman Forever, I was like,
"I'm done."
So I didn't, I didn't even bother with this one in the theater.

RICH:
I saw this movie with a girl.
Never, never saw her again.

MIKE:
Was that during the movie, you never saw her again?

RICH:
Yeah.
I just started...

MIKE:
Where'd she go?

RICH:
I turned over, and...

JAY:
She said she's gonna get more popcorn, and then she...

RICH:
Vanished.

JAY:
Vanished from the Earth.

RICH:
Vanished.

JAY:
So this women on the left here, this journalist lady, she's also in Batman Forever.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And for the longest time, I was like,
"Who the fuck is that?"
Because she has this really obnoxious voice, and they treat her like a real character for no reason.
And then I discovered, it's actually Bob Kane's wife.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
So they put her in the movie because it's Bob Kane's wife.

RICH:
Bob Kane's wife?

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Jesus Christ.
He had a, he had a little Hugh Hefner going on.

JAY:
What?

MIKE:
We're not talking about Elle McPherson.

JAY:
Yeah.
Not Elle McPherson.

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
He's talking about the, the...

JAY:
Holy shit, dude.

MIKE:
The news reporter...

JAY:
The lady with the white glasses.

RICH:
I, I...
Okay.
That makes more sense to me now.

JAY:
Elle McPherson was never married to Bob Kane, as far as I know.

MIKE:
Yeah.
She was just fucking him.
That's all.
This, this scene is, is exactly the same scene, uh, Edward Nigma, uh...

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Confronts Bruce Wayne in...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
The previous film.
It's the exact same scene.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
Where, where, yeah.
She thinks she knows exactly what needs to be done.
And Bruce Wayne's like,
"Well, no."
"If we're being realistic about it, here's the problem's with it."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And then that's her motivation.

MIKE:
Right.
And, and you know what, if, if this is inded supposed to be the same Bruce Wayne from the last film, he should know from history just to, like, go,
"Okay, crazy person."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Let me take a look at this, and I'm gonna read it."
"This sounds like a great idea."
"I'm gonna get back to you on this."
Rather than shut, shutting them down in public.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And embarrassing them.
But I guess he wouldn't know...

JAY:
Especially when you deal with supervillains on a regular basis.

MIKE:
Right.
Right.

JAY:
You think you would have their psychology down a little bit better.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
On how to deal with random weirdos.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Guess what?
Everyone you're a dick to is gonna become a supervillain and try and kill you, Batman.

MIKE:
That's Bob Kane's wife on the right, Rich.

RICH:
On the left?
What?

MIKE:
On the right.
Yeah.
It's not Uma Thurman.

JAY:
U-, Uma Thurman was Bob Kane's wife, too.

MIKE:
Although, she, she slept with Bob Kane, too.

JAY:
I like this, too, that, uh, Bruce Wayne gives her this giant, uh, elaborate invitation that I guess he just happened to have on him in case some random person approached him that he wanted to invite to the costume ball.
Where was, where was that?
Just in his jacket?

MIKE:
But he doesn't, he...
That, that's the thing is he doesn't go to that.

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
It's, it's Bruce Wayne's, like, costume ball fundraiser thing.
And then Batman is there.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But no Bruce Wayne.

JAY:
Here we have more talking to, to herself.

MIKE:
Can anybody figure this out?
I'm okay with that, though.

RICH:
I don't think it matters in this, this, this tone.
This universe.
Doesn't matter.

JAY:
The problem, though, is you reach a point where nothing matters.
And, like, you have...

RICH:
Yeah.
It is the problem.
I'm just saying, nobody cares.

JAY:
That is a big problem.
Yeah.
Something has to matter in a movie.

MIKE:
See, I thought that was Elle McPherson.

JAY:
No.
That's Vendela.
Vendela was, was super popular for, like, a month in 1997.

MIKE:
Vendela?
I don't even remember this.

JAY:
She might have been on the cover of, like, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.

MIKE:
Oh.
Look at that acting.
Arnold was just farting, and they happened to have the cameras rolling.
Come on, now.

JAY:
Was it really necessary to give, uh, Mr. Freeze the comically large bear, polar bear slippers?

MIKE:
That's hilarious, Jay.
It's hilarious.

JAY:
But it's, it's, it's in a scene where he's reminiscing about his, his wife who's dying from a disease.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
That, that contrast doesn't really work.

MIKE:
And, really, you put slippers on to keep your feet warm, and Mr. Freeze, his character...

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Is that he wants to stay cold.
So, really, it's a contradiction.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it's a real big fuck up.

RICH:
Maybe they're refrigerated slippers.

MIKE:
There you go.

RICH:
Make his, make his feet a little bit cooler.

MIKE:
And this is the way to keep your, uh, your henchman around is just to kill them.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
See, another reason.
Why would you ever wanna be a supervillain henchman?
It makes no sense.
It makes sense if your power is brainwashing.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean, that's a good way to have a loyal army behind you.
Oh, no.

JAY:
Oh, no.

MIKE:
It's one of these scenes.
Where we have a 20-minute long introduction of whatever this is.
Isn't it convenient that it's a jungle-theme party, and the villain is Poison Ivy?

RICH:
Oh, god.

JAY:
But she shows up in a giant monkey costume.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Which is very bizarre.
As does Bane, right?

MIKE:
They, I guess that's there way of sneaking in, even though she has an invitation.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I don't understand anything that's going on.
So here's Batman.

JAY:
And here, just, yeah.
Just brightly lit...

MIKE:
Gossip Gerty.
That's the character's name.

JAY:
"Gossip Gerty".
Okay.

RICH:
You maintain your aura of being, like, a horrible shadowy figure of the night by, by showing up at, like, charity balls.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
In costume.

JAY:
In this bright neon lighting.

MIKE:
With a suspicious younger man with you in tights.

JAY:
I always wondered, too, about the, there's always the black makeup around Batman and Robin's eyes.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And that's been the case since the Tim Burton movies.

MIKE:
Well...

JAY:
But it's, like, in Batman Returns, at the end of the movie, he rips his mask off...

MIKE:
And there's no...

JAY:
And it's magically gone.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So it's, like, you do that so when you're lighting Batman all dark...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And dim, you know, it just, it makes his eyes look like they're in shadow.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
But when you have this brightly-lit scene, and it's clearly just, like, nobody cared anymore at this point.

RICH:
I think, I think it's supposed to be part of the mask.

MIKE:
Yeah.
But the actor can't...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Not see.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
It, it's just, yeah.
It's just one of those things that you can't get around.

RICH:
It bends, it's bending reality a little bit.
But I'm okay with that.

JAY:
In, like, the first movie, though, I, I mean, maybe I noticed it.
I don't remember.
I haven't watched that movie in a while.
But most of the time, the way it's lit, it's, like, lit from behind or lit overhead so it just casts big shadows.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
So all it does is help hide his eyes more.
It's not meant to be where he's got black makeup on.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
And here...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You know, it just is clearly just black makeup.

MIKE:
Completely even lighting and extreme closeups, and you can see every detail of the makeup, yeah.
It's not good.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's a thing, it's a thing where it's, it's not supposed to be there, but it has to be there.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But even, Clooney's mask, it's, like, the eyeholes are much bigger than the previous ones.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They must go all the way to, like, the cheekbone.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
It's huge.

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
And it makes it more noticeable.
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Here's a scene for all the furries out there.
You got Uma Thurman stripping from a gorilla costume.

MIKE:
I don't know what you're talking about.

JAY:
That's somebody's fetish.

RICH:
Wouldn't, wouldn't the furries want Uma Thurman to put on a gorilla costume.

JAY:
I guess I don't know the, the nature of furry culture and what they, what they're into, but...
Just embarrassing.

RICH:
What?

JAY:
And now Batman and Robin just spend the rest of the movie bickering over Poison Ivy, right?
Even though she's a villain?

MIKE:
Well, she, she...

JAY:
She works her, her magical spell on them.

MIKE:
She's enchanted them with her, her pixie dust.
And her...

JAY:
My god.
Look at all of this.
We've got goofy animal costumes and Tarzan men.
How did we get to this point?

MIKE:
Uh, a flamboyant gay director named Joel Schumacher.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
That's how we got to this point, Jay.

RICH:
The end of a career.
Or at least the end of a reputation.

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, he still did stuff after this.
He still does stuff, but...

RICH:
He's remembered for this.

JAY:
He's, that's...
I think that's it.
This is, yeah.
A mark.
When people think of Joel Schumacher, they think of how he ruined the Batman series.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Look how big those eyeholes are.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.
I, I'm looking at it now.
That does look awful.

JAY:
And this is still the Batman costume where he can't turn his head left or right.
And we didn't get out of that until the second Nolan movie.
They actually put a line of dialogue into the movie where he says,
"I wanna be able to turn my head."
Like, why did it take them so long to come up with a costume design where Batman could actually turn his head?

RICH:
Because they needed to make it out of thick rubber.
I don't know.

JAY:
I, I think they were just stuck with the original Tim Burton idea of, you know, the cowl just being one big thing.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And they were...
I dunno if they were scared to deviate from it, or they thought people wouldn't accept it, but when you get to The Dark Knight, it doesn't matter.
He can turn his head to the left and right, and it looks like more of a helmet thing.
But you can still tell it's Batman.

RICH:
The cowl can be one thick thing.
I just don't know if there's any reason it needs to be made out of rubber that's so thick you can't turn your head.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I really don't know or care.

RICH:
I know.

JAY:
Do you care about the Bat credit card?

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
It's coming up.
Which is like a joke out of a Zucker Brothers movie.
And that, it's weird, because it's the only gag like that in this movie.

MIKE:
The Goth card.

JAY:
The Goth card.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's like, uh, strange.

RICH:
At least make a product placement.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
That's the weird thing, too, is that, yeah.
That's the type of gag you would put in there if you had a deal with Mastercard or Visa...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Or something.
But it's a made up credit card company.
And it's a terrible joke.

RICH:
That means somebody just thought it was funny.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I, I, it's, it's not, not explainable.
If this movie was just filled with jokes like that, I think I would enjoy it a lot.

JAY:
That's the thing, is that's the only gag like that.
Like, the rest, the movie's campy, or whatever, but it doesn't have any sort of fourth wall-breaking nonsense jokes like that.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Except for that one.

MIKE:
It's so embarrassing.

RICH:
Never, never go to a charity ball where Batman's around.
Just don't, just don't do it.

JAY:
Yeah.
It seems inevitable that a bad guy's gonna show up because he knows he's there.

MIKE:
Yep.
Especially a bad guy they, they pursued and lost five minutes ago.

JAY:
So if anyone is actually trying to follow along to the movie...

MIKE:
Look at that!
That looked convincing.

JAY:
If anyone is trying to follow along with the movie, we're at, uh, 46:52 seconds right now.
Uh, Poison Ivy is...
Mr. Freeze has just, uh, confronted Poison Ivy.

MIKE:
I like that he comes up with, with stupid villain names for her.
"Who are you?"
"Garden Girl?"
You know...
"Vine Lady?"
I think that's kind of funny.

JAY:
It's funny in the sense that all those names would not be surprising if that was her name in this movie.

MIKE:
It's fine.
Also, his face has gone from blue to silver.
No.

JAY:
"No."

MIKE:
It needs to be silver when he's in this costume, and it's blue when he's out of it.

RICH:
I think I'm, I think I'm with Mike on that.

JAY:
Really?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
I'll pay closer attention to it.
I haven't noticed.

MIKE:
Well...
What, what are those things that they keep punching through?

JAY:
They're, like, ch-, trays.
Like, serving trays.

MIKE:
But why do they show them so many times?

JAY:
That I don't know.

RICH:
Somebody thought they were neat?

MIKE:
"Cool party."
Well, this may be a good time -- I don't know if it is or isn't -- but I, I...

JAY:
It's never a good time to bring up the puns, if that's what you're talking about.

MIKE:
I wrote down all the ice puns.
The, the, we will get many plant puns later.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, Batgirl says a lot of them towards the end of the film.
But, um, I wrote down all the, all the cold puns.

JAY:
Well, that, that...

RICH:
You, you are the pun-master.

MIKE:
Well, I don't know if I'd say "master", but...

JAY:
Well, the thing is, when people complain about this movie, that's one of the main things they bring up is all the ice puns.
But most of 'em aren't even puns.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
That's what everybody calls 'em, but they're not exactly puns.

MIKE:
They're just...
S-, some of 'em are puns.
Some of 'em are just...

JAY:
Oh, wait.
We just missed Commissioner Gordon for five seconds.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
That was his role.

MIKE:
"Enough monkey business."

JAY:
And now we have Bane in a monkey suit.
And then Bane says,
"Monkey business."
"Monkey work!"
That's what he says.

MIKE:
Yeah.
But the, yeah.
There's a lot of punny kind of lines in, in this movie.
And I don't know if that's...
I don't know.
You, Rich, you always complain that Spider-Man movies never had enough, uh, quips...

RICH:
Quips.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or kind of lines like that.
But this movie is just filled with them.
How do you feel about that?

RICH:
Well, if you're going for camp Batman, I mean, there is precedent.
Adam West Batman, uh, that's fine.
If you're going for, for Dark Knight Batman, not fine at all.
But this, it's almost somewhere in between, just...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Visually.
You know, it's dark.
It's got that weird Tim Burton gothy look.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Um...

RICH:
It's not quite bright enough to be a straight-up Adam West homage.

MIKE:
Right.
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Kind of in the middle.
I, I like this little sequence.
I like all the little miniatures and how they're riding down the arm and...

JAY:
Some of the CG's a little dated, but whatever.
But the thing that bothers me about this is Batman's like,
"You're a hothead, Robin."
"I'm gonna deactivate your motorcycle because this is too dangerous of a jump."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But at the beginning of the movie, they were surfing through the air.

RICH:
Is this really a safe spot to disable his motorcycle?

MIKE:
I was just gonna say...

JAY:
That, too.
Yeah.
They're, they're going down on a, you know, downward slope.

RICH:
Now he's definitely going to die.

JAY:
He could just...
Yeah.
That thing could just keep sliding down, and you fall off the building.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He almost die just try to kill him.
But getting back to the, the puns and the camp.
In the last film, they sort of poked fun at the, the 60's Batman and Robin.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
With the "holy..."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
"Rusted metal", right?

MIKE:
"Holy rusted metal, Batman."
Like, when they land on Edward Nigma's island.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
And then, and then Batman's like,
"What?"
And he's like,
"There's rusted metal, and there's lots of holes in it."
"Holy rusted metal."
And they're like,
"Ha ha ha ha!"
"Isn't it silly how campy those sayings are?"
And then...

JAY:
But you're making a bad campy movie.

MIKE:
Then they just do it.

JAY:
"Then they just do it."

MIKE:
This is a stupid shot.

JAY:
Well, the stupid thing about this is, like, we don't even get to see...
Like, you could have a cool fistfight between them.
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger and, and Batman.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And they just don't even show anything.

MIKE:
Well, he probably can't move in that plastic costume.

JAY:
Yeah.
I guess.

MIKE:
They, they filmed it, and it was terrible.
So they said,
"Just stand on him."
"He just fell down and he can't get up."

RICH:
Could it, could it be an Arnold Schwarzenegger ego thing, where he wouldn't wanna be bested...

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

RICH:
In hand-to-hand combat...

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
By a character?

MIKE:
"See, I just fell down."

JAY:
I guess that's possible.

MIKE:
"And then he st-, stood on me."
Uh, anyways.
So now, here's the story.
Here's an attempt to have some story.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
As Joel Schumacher would say.
Um...

JAY:
"An attempt to have."

MIKE:
Batman and Robin are feuding over, uh...
Robin wants to be just as cool as Batman, but Batman says,
"No, you're gonna hurt yourself."
And then they also both love Poison Ivy.
So anyway.
Back to the ice puns.
Would you like to hear them all?

RICH:
Y-, yes!
Yes I would!

MIKE:
Okay.
It starts off with, um,
"The iceman cometh."

RICH:
Not a pun.

MIKE:
"That condition has left me cold."
"The.."
This is everything cold related.
It's not all puns.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
"The ultimate fate in the universe: everything freezes."
"You're not sending me to the cooler."
"Who killed the dinosaurs?"
"The Ice Age."
Which is not...

JAY:
Which is factually incorrect.

MIKE:
Factually incorrect.
Um, uh...
"Freeze well."
"Stay cool, bird boy."
"Can you be cold, Batman?"
"Talk about a cold shoulder."
"My passion thaws for my bride alone."
"All right, everyone."
"Chill."
"Cool party."
"It's a cold town, Batman."
"Welcome home, frost-face."
"What's the cure for the common cold?"
"Allow me to break the ice."
And then this one's weird.
"Icehead."

JAY:
Icehead?

RICH:
Just icehead?

MIKE:
I...
Well, he calls someone an icehead.
Uh...

JAY:
Who does he call an icehead?

MIKE:
I don't know.
Uh...
"I heard you were blue."
"Let's cool it for now."
"Always winterize your pipes."
"Chilled to perfection."
That one's not bad, huh?
"Who needs a frigid wife around?"
"Their bones will turn to ice."
"Their blood will freeze."
"Revenge is a dish best served cold."
"Tonight, hell freezes over."
"Let's kick some ice."

JAY:
Oh, that's, that's...

RICH:
Oh...

JAY:
That is a pun.
It's terrible, but...

MIKE:
"Hey, Freeze."

RICH:
Is it?
It's, it's, it's trying to be.
It wants to be a pun.

JAY:
Sure.

RICH:
It's, it's..

JAY:
That's more than just saying "cool party".

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
You know?

MIKE:
Um...
"Hey, Freeze."
"The heat is on."
And,
"Freeze in hell, Batman."
I don't even know what that means.

RICH:
It's just wrong.

JAY:
Yeah.
The expression is "burn in hell".

RICH:
But he said "freeze".

JAY:
But that doesn't make any sense.
Oh, wait.
Remember when Alicia Silverstone was in this movie?

RICH:
No, I don't.

JAY:
Well, here she is.
Or at least her double.
We don't get any looks at her face.

MIKE:
She could only film for five minutes that day.

RICH:
Batman, Batman did a horrible job of training Robin.
He just got beat by a teenage girl.

MIKE:
He wasn't expecting her to have super ninja skills, Rich.

RICH:
Where did she learn the super ninja skills?

JAY:
I was gonna say, do they explain that at all?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Because at the end of the movie, she shows up in the Batcave and, uh, Max Headroom version of Alfred is just like,
"I thought you might find this, so I made you a costume."

MIKE:
Well, the, the story with her is that her parents died, and she, she deals with the loss of her parents by having kind of like a deathwish, or, uh, uh, whatever you would call it.
Where she, uh, uh, danger...

JAY:
Lives life on the edge.

MIKE:
Danger thrills her or whatever.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, whatever condition that is.
So.
I guess she got in lots of fights, and does dangerous drag racing just to satisfy something.
I don't know.

RICH:
Is this the first time that they brought up Arkham Asylum in these movies?

MIKE:
Uh, no.

JAY:
No.
It's at the end of Batman Forever.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They actually shot a scene where Tommy Lee Jones escapes from Ar-, Arkham Asylum in the beginning.
But they didn't put it in the movie.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
It just starts with him doing something.

RICH:
He's just there.
It was so weird.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
So, that, yeah.
There, that security guard on the far left...
Oh, he just exited frame.
Oh.
No.
That one right there.
That's Jesse Ventura.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
Hey.

JAY:
So we have our little Predator reunion.
"Allow me to break the ice."
Is he just looking right at the camera, now?

MIKE:
Oh.
"It's the chilling sound of your doom."
I forgot that one.
Yeah.
He is.

RICH:
Watched me some old WWF videos after Roddy Piper died, and Jesse Ventura is a great commentator.

JAY:
Oh, sure.
Look at this, this acting here.

MIKE:
It's just heartbreaking.
Oh, my god.

JAY:
This is the worst ever.

RICH:
That's, like, what Arnold looks like now.

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
It's him on the set to Expendables 3.

MIKE:
Oh...

JAY:
They already made Expendables 3.

RICH:
Did they?
Oh.

JAY:
Expendables 4.

RICH:
They, they're cranking 'em out, aren't they?

JAY:
They, yeah.
You got, you gotta make 'em before everybody dies.

MIKE:
Oh...
So that's a cold zone, I guess?

JAY:
Yeah.
He gets too far out of it, and he can't breathe or whatever.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Apparently, it's very easy to break into Arkham Asylum.

MIKE:
Well, you just say you're a visitor, and they'll let you walk into the, the...

JAY:
Especially if you're dressed like that.

MIKE:
Right.
Yeah.

JAY:
Either of them.
Oh, wait.
No.
She's not in Arkham yet.
She goes there later.

MIKE:
She goes there later.
I don't...

JAY:
Here she's going to the Turkish bath.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's an abandoned Turkish bath that she turns into her secret Poison Ivy lair.

RICH:
Yeah.
You move that board, Bane.

JAY:
Bane smash!

MIKE:
Hey, Poison Ivy needs the muscle.

RICH:
It's the Neon Gang!

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, god.
Another neon thing.

JAY:
There was a big scene like that in Forever, too, right?

MIKE:
Yep.
Where, when Robin steals the Batmobile and gets in a little street fight.

JAY:
I don't...
This movie doesn't seem to have as much of an intrusive, like, uh, hip soundtrack.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
I remember that...
The Batman Forever did.
There was, like...
What was it?
U2 was on there.
And, like, The Flaming Lips.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Smashing Pumpkins.

JAY:
Offspring.

MIKE:
That was a good soundtrack, actually.

JAY:
There was, I think, there was, like, one song from this one.
And I don't even remember what it is.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That was a well-selling, um, popular soundtrack, too.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's a, it's a surprise they didn't try it with this.
Maybe they did, and it just didn't have as good songs.

JAY:
I think they were out of money by the time they got to the soundtrack.

MIKE:
"We have no more money to license these songs."

JAY:
"We spent all of our money making toys."

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
Silly gang members.
Kryptonite doesn't work on Bane.

MIKE:
He just defeats them all by launching them comically into the air.
I hate this movie.

JAY:
Why...
Why did they just decide to pick this place to be a secret bad guy lair?

MIKE:
Because...

RICH:
Well, I mean, you could say that about any place they pick to be a secret bad guy lair, really.

JAY:
I guess.
I mean, in, like, Batman Returns, the Penguin picks the sewer because he was abandoned in the sewer.
Like, there's some sort of connection.
Here, it's just,
"Hey, here's a building."
Just randomly.

MIKE:
Well, it's a Turkish bath.
Formally Turkish bath.
So maybe she needs the water to grow plant life.
And that's exactly what happens.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So...

JAY:
Oh, is that referenced?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Maybe, maybe you should pay attention.
It's not referenced, but it's, it's clearly implied.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, she says...

JAY:
Well, you know what?
Then I, I, I redact my complaint.

MIKE:
Because Bane knocked the thing off, and a bunch of water started pouring.

JAY:
And now some animated plants are showing up.

MIKE:
Now it becomes a Walt Disney film.

JAY:
I was gonna say, it looks like, uh, Merry Poppins or something.
Only much, much uglier.
Yeah, this, this movie is so ugly, too.
Like, they're going for bright, colorful, lots of neon lights, lots of Dutch angles to make it comic book-y, I guess.
But it all ends up being, like, this garish nightmare.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Like the last one.

JAY:
Yeah.
Even moreso than the last one, though.
Oh, wait.
Here's this subplot.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
Elle McPherson wants to get married, and Bruce Wayne doesn't.
And then she just leaves the movie.
There's, there's no point to any of this.

MIKE:
She's...

JAY:
It doesn't...
It's not like he's even conflicted about it.
And, and she's not even a character.
She's just supermodel in movie.

MIKE:
Right.
She, her, she's terrible at looping her dialogue, too.

JAY:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
It's, it's like a, like a foreign film almost.
There's this just, like, bizarre whisper.
And, like, she has no idea what she's doing.
There's a lot of that bad ADR in this film.

JAY:
Yeah?

MIKE:
Lot of it.
It's terrible.

JAY:
I remember there was one really noticeable one at the beginning when they're surfing down.
And then Mr. Freeze, like, he aims his freeze gun down, and he's shooting, and you can't tell what's happening.
So they ADR'd a line in, where Robin's like,
"He's freezing the pipes..."

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
"So he can land safely."
Like, something really generic...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And bad.

MIKE:
"Here's food for thought."
This is the scene, it's like a four-year old wrote it.
"Bruce, I think we should get married."
"We've been dating a year."
"I'm not the marrying type."
"Well, I have to leave now."
Uh...
"Here's food for thought in case you change your mind."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
A kiss.

JAY:
I mean, I guess there's a thing here where he's picturing Poison Ivy.
But we already know that he has a thing for her because...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
She cast a spell on him or whatever.

RICH:
Should she leave frame like Poochie?

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
"I have to go my home planet now."

JAY:
I think she has one other scene after this.
But it, it just goes nowhere.

MIKE:
Right.
And I wonder who's decision it was to have him, you know...
I don't know if that's, uh, uh, to quote Mr. Plinkett, "a case of the notgays".
You know, like...

JAY:
It might be because the rest of the movie it's just him bickering with Robin.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
That's, like, the entire movie.

MIKE:
Maybe it's Clooney who said that, like,
"I'll be in this movie, but I don't want Batman to be a creepy guy who has a, a boy living in his house."
Do you know what I mean?

JAY:
Yeah.
It's possible.

MIKE:
Like, if that was his decision or a studio...
I'm sure it was someone's, you know, because it does absolutely nothing for the storyline.

JAY:
Yeah.
What is the storyline at this point, by the way?

MIKE:
Uh, the...

JAY:
I'm trying to keep track.

MIKE:
The surface-level storyline, or the character storyline?

JAY:
The, the, the, uh, character storyline.

MIKE:
Um...

JAY:
Like, what is Poison Ivy's motivation anymore?
I don't even remember.

MIKE:
She wants...

JAY:
She's just mad at Batman, right?

MIKE:
Her and...
No, no, no.
Well, maybe.
Her and...
Oh, my god.
The Clockwork Orange Gang?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's embarrassing.

JAY:
You should not reference a much better movie in your movie.

MIKE:
Um...

RICH:
Was she forgotten about the environment?

MIKE:
Yeah.
She wants to turn...

JAY:
Wait, wait.
Shut up.
It's Coolio.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
How embarrassing.
And that's Coolio.
He must've had a song on the soundtrack.

JAY:
Probably.

MIKE:
Anyway.
Um, Mr. Freeze wants to freeze the whole world, and then Poison Ivy wants to turn the whole world into a plant world.

RICH:
So, obviously, they work together.
Because these, these two goals are completely compatible.

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes.

JAY:
Okay.
So this, uh, bike rider guy...
Not that little kid.

MIKE:
Uh-huh.

JAY:
Um, but the one that was just talking to Alicia Silverstone.
That's, actor is Nicky Katt, who is also in The Dark Knight.
Yeah.
The guy getting on the motorcycle now with the, the mohawk thing.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's, uh, like, one of the SWAT guys driving in that big car chase in the middle of, uh, The Dark Knight.

MIKE:
And you know this, why?

JAY:
Well, because Nicky Katt.
He's somewhat of a known actor.
But I just think it's interesting that he's in this schlock, and then he's also in The Dark Knight.

RICH:
Is he the same character?

JAY:
I, in, yeah.
In my, in my mind, he's the same character.
He turned his life around after being a street thug in this, and started working, uh, for, as a SWAT guy to transport the Joker.
No.
Nicky Katt, he was in Dazed and Confused.
He's been in some stuff.
He's in Suburbia.
The, uh, Richard Linklater film.

MIKE:
Jay, no one cares.

JAY:
I just think it's neat that he's in this, and then he was in The Dark Knight.

MIKE:
That is...

JAY:
He's the only, probably the only actor that's been in both...

RICH:
That is, that is the least interesting commentary trivia that I have ever heard.

MIKE:
You know what also, Jay?
They filmed this with cameras.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
And they also filmed The Dark Knight with cameras.
I think there's a motorcyle in The Dark Knight somewhere, too.

RICH:
He rides, he rides a Batcycle.
That's a whole big scene in the movie.

MIKE:
There was a, a drum that was filled with, with glitter that just got knocked over.
Can we talk about that?

JAY:
That's the point we've gotten to.

MIKE:
What kind of stupid bike race is this?
Just, the obstacles, and...?

RICH:
It's where Rip Taylor stores his glitter.
He stores, he stores his...

MIKE:
"Oh, my glitter warehouse!"

RICH:
"They broke into my glitter warehouse!"
"Oh, no!"

MIKE:
This must be where they filmed the famous Grease scene in California.
It looks like it.
It probably is.

RICH:
Who are these guys?

MIKE:
Alicia Silverstone has a death wish because his parents died.
So now she gets into violent motorcycle races.
It also prepares her and gives her legitimacy to become one of the greatest superheroes of all time, Batgirl.
Rich, are you embarrassed that you've read comic books?

RICH:
I'm embarrassed that I've seen this movie.

MIKE:
Can you imagine having been in this movie?

RICH:
You know what?
It probably would mean I got paid.
I'm fine with that.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's true.
That's true.

JAY:
Yeah.
This was kind of a dark time for comic book movies.
This was, like, Steel, starring Shaq.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
What else was around at that time?

MIKE:
Mm...Blade?

RICH:
Meteor Man?

JAY:
No.
Blade's, I think Blade was a little bit later.

RICH:
Blankman.

JAY:
Blankman.

MIKE:
That was a com-, comedy.

JAY:
That wasn't based on a comic book, though.

RICH:
I know.
I know.

JAY:
Yeah.
And just a couple years later, it was X-Men, and that's what kind of turned things around, I guess.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And there, there was, they were even going to make, uh, they had plans for the film after this.
With Joel Schumacher directing it.

JAY:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
Yep.
And they were gonna...

JAY:
I'm assuming that was before it was released, right?

RICH:
What were they gonna do?

MIKE:
They, they were gonna have the Sandman in it, and...

RICH:
Sandman?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's Spider-Man.

MIKE:
Oh.
I was gonna make a joke that they gonna say he was gonna be played by Bill Cosby.
Because he puts you to sleep.

RICH:
Wah-waaaahhhhh...

MIKE:
You know, I fucked it up.
I'm sorry.

JAY:
It still works, though.
Because you got to work the joke in.

MIKE:
What's the guy...
Oh, the Scarecrow.
That's...

JAY:
The Scarecrow, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's the guy with the bag on his head.
Do you ever won-...
Do you ever sit there at night and just think like,
"If this were a Christopher Nolan movie, how they would they do Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy?"

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Christopher Nolan would never do Mr. Freeze.
They're, they're obsessed with realism too much.

MIKE:
But how would you do it?

JAY:
Yeah.
Is there a way to make that character real?
I mean, they did it with...

RICH:
You couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't the he-needs-to-be-cold-all-the-time thing.
You couldn't do the freeze ray.
It would be so different, it may as well be a different character.

MIKE:
He, he would just be, like a, like a bad person that fr-, that puts you in a freezer to kill you.
And he's a psychopath.

JAY:
And that would be it.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I, I want, like, a app on my phone or a website where you say,
"Christopher Nolanize this villain."
Christopher Nolanize...
Okay.
Ready, Rich?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Christopher Nolanize, uh, the Green Lantern.
That may be the hardest one of all.
Christopher Nolanize the Blob.

JAY:
I think any, any superhero that can fly, I don't even know if you can Christopher Nolanize it.

RICH:
He's, he's got...
The ring is, like, a larger contraption.
It's, it's got a big fat ring around his finger with wires that go down, and they hook to a huge gauntlet on his arm.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
And it doesn't make fancy shapes.
But it does generate a shield around him.
And it does shoot out laser beams.

MIKE:
No, no, no, no, no.

JAY:
Yeah.
No laser beams.

RICH:
You'd have to, you'd have to have space and alien technology.
I mean, that's the premise.
The premise is, he's a space cop.

MIKE:
Okay.
May-, maybe, maybe, uh, uh, Green Lantern is a little too advanced...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
For the Christopher Nolanizing, uh, process.
Let's see...

RICH:
Like, Green Goblin.

MIKE:
Green Goblin.
Oh, my god.
A, a man with a deformed face.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
Because of, um, some kind of acid who, who puts, like, noxious gas in a pumpkin.
Or acid in real pumpkins.

RICH:
And he just throws them.

MIKE:
And just throws them at you, yeah.
And has, like, tattered green clothing, maybe.
Maybe.

JAY:
It'd have to be a dark green.

MIKE:
It'd have to be very dark and muted, yeah.
And disgusting-looking.

JAY:
Can you imagine a Christopher Nolan movie that just has this version of Mr. Freeze in it?

MIKE:
I, I, I...
My mind was wandering there with Uma Thurman, and, um, the Bane from Dark Knight Rises.
Kind of following her around.

RICH:
Why am I in this movie?

MIKE:
And he just, like, punch her and murder her.
"Let me tell you this, Bane."
"Come with..."

JAY:
Wait.
Would, would it be this version of Poison Ivy...

MIKE:
"Will you tell me this..."

JAY:
In the Nolan version of Bane?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Okay.
Or what if you just replaced the Nolan Bane with this Bane?
And he's, like, the part when he's at the, towards the end of the movie when he's got everybody in the, uh, the football field or whatever.
And he's got the microphone, and he's just yelling,
"Bane!"
Instead of some long, complicated speech.
"Grarrrr!"

MIKE:
"Who is that?"

RICH:
"Why do you keep making ice puns?"
"It makes no sense."

MIKE:
"Your ice puns are terrible."
Oh, no.

JAY:
Even though at the end of the last movie, didn't Tommy Lee Jones just, like, fall to his death into the ocean or something?

MIKE:
Not the ocean.

JAY:
Some sort of body of water.

MIKE:
A pit with spikes on the bottom.

JAY:
Oh, that's right.

RICH:
Should, should they make a movie, Nolan Batman Versus Joel Schumacher Batman?
Like, some kind of dimensional rift.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Didn't they do that with the Ninja Turtles?

RICH:
Like, the universe's collide.

MIKE:
That would be great.

JAY:
Didn't they do that...
Like, the modern Ninja Turtles cartoon, they team up with the 80's Ninja Turtles.

RICH:
Probably?

JAY:
It, it was, like, uh...
I don't know if it was a one episode thing.
But I know that happened.
And here we have Bane pushing a shopping cart.

MIKE:
Oh...

JAY:
That's where we're at.
And Uma Thurman's got hair boobs on her head.

MIKE:
Is that a reference to, uh, who is it, Julia Newmar?
Right?
Catwoman?

RICH:
Yeah.
But that's not Catwoman.

MIKE:
I know, I know that.
But didn't she have the same hairst-, hairdo?

RICH:
No.
She had, she had little cat ears.

JAY:
No.
She had little cat ears.

MIKE:
Little cat ears?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.
I thought maybe they had her hair like that.
I guess I'm wrong.
Wouldn't, wouldn't...
Sorry.
I'm just looking at Arnold's, uh, prison uniform.
It's, like, gigantic on him.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Wouldn't they have, had a problem with it being too small?
Why is it so big?

RICH:
Because they...
I think they wanted him to seem frail without the suit.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
I don't think he's supposed to be...

JAY:
They didn't want him to look like big muscular Arnold.

RICH:
I don't think he's supposed to be a buff man.

MIKE:
Mm...

RICH:
Even though everyone knows Arnold Schwarzenegger is buff...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
And the illusion is just ruined instantly because you know Arnold too well.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He's supposed to be...

RICH:
I think.
I think?

MIKE:
A more pathetic character.
And the suit gives him power?

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Well, that, they did a great job casting him.

JAY:
They took the, yeah.
The only thing Arnold is known for is being a big buff dude that does, that doesn't speak English great.

MIKE:
Arnold should have been Bane.

JAY:
Yeah.
There you go.

MIKE:
But I guess he probably wouldn't wanna yell like Frankenstein, right?

RICH:
You just, you just write him differently.

MIKE:
Sorry.
Correction.
Frankenstein's monster.

JAY:
You have to clarify that.

MIKE:
Wer-, weren't you gonna get all over that, Rich?

RICH:
No.
I'm not that anal.

JAY:
Didn't you know that Frankenstein is the name of the scientist, and not the monster.

MIKE:
Yeah.
R-, right.

JAY:
Did you know that?

MIKE:
Did you know that, Rich?
That's a common misconception.

RICH:
So they're both named Frankenstein?
That's kind of confusing.

MIKE:
No.
It, the monster doesn't have a name.
But it, it's a common misconception.

RICH:
I've, I've seen...
He has a name.
It's Frankenstein.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
"Bane!"

MIKE:
"Bane jump!"
Oh, my god.
Did they have a plan to wh-, what they're gonna land in, or no?

JAY:
They're just gonna jump into the water and hope for the best.

RICH:
They're gonna freeze the water so it hurst extra.

MIKE:
"Alfred, are you well?"
"As soon as can be expected, sir."

JAY:
It's like there's no flow to any of these subplots.
It' just,
"Here's the scene where this happens."
"Now here's the scene where Alfred talks about being sick."

MIKE:
Alfred should never have ordered that pizza.

RICH:
It gave him Gershwins's Disease?

MIKE:
McGregor's Syndrome.

RICH:
Or what is it, what is it called?

JAY:
McGregor's Syndrome.

MIKE:
"The pizza we ordered, Master, Master Wayne, gave me McGregor's Syndrome."
"I tried to shat it out, but it didn't work."

JAY:
"I've been constipated for the last fifteen years, sir."

MIKE:
"My, my guts are about to burst."

RICH:
"The buildup has given me McGregor's Syndrome."

MIKE:
"And only Arnold can cure that, because he is also full of shit."

RICH:
"Eventually, I will shit out my mouth and die."

MIKE:
"That's no way for a proper British man to die."
"What should Mr. Freeze's lair look like?"
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Wait, wait.
It's Commissioner Gordon.
He's back.

MIKE:
Yep.
He's back.

JAY:
"Here's the thing, Batman."
"I'll see you later."

MIKE:
There's the photo.
She's covering her face, but he's not.

RICH:
That's great.

JAY:
This big budget film, but they skimped on the photoshop.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They couldn't, couldn't take a photo of them in front of a plane.

JAY:
"Bye, Commissioner Gordon."

MIKE:
It would've been too hard.

RICH:
Is there anything to like about this movie?

JAY:
Um...no?

MIKE:
No.
I don't think so.
If you're a small child, maybe.

JAY:
Well that's the problem.
I mean, this is aimed at kids, which is, I don't know.
When you're coming off the heels of the Tim Burton ones, that's disappointing.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Did kids even like this?

JAY:
I don't think so.
I think this was a big ol' flop.
Wait.
How did Batman know that this was back here?

RICH:
He's Batman.

JAY:
He goes right up to the thing and opens the secret compartment.
Was it established...
Did I miss it?
Did they establish that he knows this?

MIKE:
They did not.
But I'm going to say, Batman's house has all sorts of secret compartments and trap doors and ways to get into the batcave.
So he's very familiar with these kind of things.

RICH:
They never really played it up in these movie, but comic book Batman, very good detective.

JAY:
Sure.
That has nothing to do with this, though.

RICH:
Nothing to do with this.

JAY:
And our villains are just right underneath 'em.

MIKE:
Well, they have a trap set.
Don't they?
Or no?
Are they just hiding in there?

JAY:
They're just spying on 'em.

MIKE:
I don't know.

JAY:
And talking at normal volume right below their feet.

MIKE:
So here's the subplot about, uh, I think they look at a screen, and it says,
"Stage 1 Solved."
"Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4 unsolved."

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Is that what happens?

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then that's how we know that, uh, Arnold has cracked a cure for Stage 1 of MacGregor's Syndrome.
Conveniently what Alfred is what afflicted with.

JAY:
This looks like a Power Rangers set.

MIKE:
It does.
Oh, my god.

RICH:
This looks too cheesy to be a Power Rangers set.

MIKE:
The Power Rangers would be embarrassed to film in this location.

JAY:
See, I think that's the big difference between this and the old TV show is, like, everyone says,
"Oh, they're both campy or whatever."
But the old show, from what I remember, had actual jokes, right?
Like, it was a comedy show.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
More or less, yeah.

JAY:
Because I remember the movie, there's the part when he's got the bomb, and it's, like hilarious...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because he can't get rid of the bomb.
There's, like, nuns walking by.
It's an actual joke.
There's no jokes in this movie.
It's just corny.

RICH:
There's, there's an episode of the old TV series where the Penguin is running for mayor, so Batman runs for mayor to stop the Penguin from being mayor.
And, like, Batman is losing the election because he refuses to kiss a baby because he doesn't want to give the baby germs.
It's not hygenic.

MIKE:
Now that's writing.
Can we intercut that Batman vs Bane fight with the one from the Nolan film?

JAY:
Yeah.
They're both on, like, a catwalk thing.

MIKE:
Yep.
Yep.

RICH:
I wanna see a crossover movie so bad.

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Oh, no.
Batman fell on pillows.

JAY:
Yeah.
This is just like The Dark Knight rises, isn't it?

MIKE:
There were giant ice cream cro-, cones in, uh...

RICH:
Or just remake Dark Knight Rises, only it's this Bane.
It's just,
"Rawrrr!"

JAY:
Yeah.
Keeping all the long speeches, but it's just incomprehensible growling.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh.
The leaves on her eyebrows have changed colors.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They were green before.

JAY:
Is that a part of her anatomy, or is that, like, an accessory?

RICH:
I'm assuming it's accessory.

JAY:
No.
Because she came out of the ground with those.

RICH:
It's fall now.

JAY:
I think that's, that's a part of her...

RICH:
She's, she's hanging out with the cold man...

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
No?

MIKE:
Because, because after she turned into Poison Ivy, she went back as nerdy scientist lady.

JAY:
Oh, that's right.

MIKE:
So...

JAY:
She glues those on every day.

MIKE:
I think she paint...
She glues them on.
She painstakingly...
She bought them at a Halloween store.

JAY:
And she has to take the time every day...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
To decide...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Which color she wants to put on.

MIKE:
Well, she, she dyed her hair red, and, and...
Oh, no.
She put a wig on.

JAY:
No, she put a wig on.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's right.

JAY:
Because she had to get in diguise, even though no one knew who she was anyway.

JAY:
"HEAT."
Look at that.
It just says "HEAT".

MIKE:
So the logic of this room and building is that it's an ice cream-making place?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And then, for some reason, there's a giant switch that makes everything cold inside of it.
Because that's how you make ice cream.
Where all the employees freeze at the same temperature ice cream is made.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
It all makes sense.
It all makes sense.
Oh, god.

JAY:
"Bane!"

MIKE:
I'm gonna intercut Bane fighting Batman with the other Bane fighting Batman.
I just have to do this.
I wonder if you could.

JAY:
Even if you could get it to cut where it kind of looks like where it almost matches?

MIKE:
Yeah.
One versus...

JAY:
I'm gonna say no.

MIKE:
One versus the other.

JAY:
I'm gonna say it won't match.
Everyone's just falling into pillows and boxes.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
The end, with the rubber lips.
Do you remember that?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It just peels off.
It's so terrible.

RICH:
Rubber lips?

MIKE:
Robin kiss...

JAY:
Yeah.
That's how Robin foils, uh, Cat-...
Catwoman.
Poison Ivy.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
By having ru-...
He has rubber over his lips.

RICH:
I don't remember that.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But he only peels it off the top lip, and it just looks like...
I don't know what it looks like.
It's a thin layer of something.

RICH:
Oh...

MIKE:
What he really needed was those wax lips that you, that you buy...

JAY:
Those comical fake lips?
Yeah.

MIKE:
It just cuts back, and he's just wearing them, and we didn't notice it before.
"Wax lips!"

MIKE:
Okay.
Someone make a cum joke.

JAY:
I was, I was...

MIKE:
Rich...

JAY:
I was holding back.

MIKE:
Who's got it?
Who's got it?
That's the level we operate on.

JAY:
You almost...

MIKE:
Look at it.
It's on his chest.

JAY:
You almost can't even make a joke.
It's just like,
"Yeah."
"It looks like cum."
"The end."

MIKE:
Yeah.
I guess.

MIKE:
I like, I like this, this performance here.
Watch this.
Bam.
She's very good.
She's very good.
Uma Thurman.

JAY:
Uma Thurman's a good actress.
And she's the only one in this movie that, that is kind of going with the, uh, stupidity of everything.

MIKE:
Yep.

RICH:
We need to make our own p-, puns.
Like, she kicks that thing out.
"This movie's coming...unplugged."

MIKE:
She should.
She should just rewrite all of her dialogue.
Say whatever she wants.

JAY:
Maybe she did, and this is the best that they came up with.

MIKE:
But, yeah.
She definitely rises above the material.
And, and almost like she's aware of that this is going to be terrible...

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
When no one else is.

JAY:
Yeah.
Arnold's being Arnold.

RICH:
She knows the tone it needs to work.

JAY:
Nobody else does.

MIKE:
I wonder if they got any direction.
You know what I mean?

JAY:
Considering everybody seems to be in a different movie, it's doubtful.
Joel Schumacher was more concerned with, like, the lighting and the, the wire work.
Oh, wait.
Look at this magical effect.

RICH:
How do you direct Arnold Schwarzenegger?
How do you do that?

JAY:
I don't know.

MIKE:
You say,
"Here's your line."
"Their bones should turn to ice."

RICH:
"I say these things."

JAY:
Look.
He looks angry here.
His direction was "act angry".

MIKE:
"You're mad."

JAY:
"You're mad."

MIKE:
"Uma told you that Batman and Robin killed your wife."
"So now you're mad."

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
So she, uh, unplugs Mr. Freeze's wife...

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Because she says, uh, uh,
"I want him for myself."
Right?
Or something like that?
Like, that's her motivation for doing so.

MIKE:
Sort of.
I g-, I thinks she just wants to get him on her side to kill them.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
But her goal is to turn, eradicate humans and turn the world into a plant paradise.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And his goal is to freeze the world.

RICH:
His goal initially is to cure his wife, right?

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I think this is her...
I haven't been paying enough attention.
Is this her, is this her attempt to change his motivation into destroying the world?

JAY:
Your wife's dead, so now just destroy the world.

MIKE:
Yeah, I think so.
"Mother Nature to start again."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Behold the dawn of a new age."
Oh.

JAY:
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

RICH:
Audrey III.

JAY:
But that's...

MIKE:
Mutant plants.

JAY:
Like, it's, it's terrible.
The animatronics on that.
It's like something you buy at Spencer's Gifts.

MIKE:
Just goes left and right.

JAY:
Yeah.
Oh, Uma.
I'm so sorry.


MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
She, she just said we'll, we'll be the only two people left in the world.
"Adam and Evil."

RICH:
What do the henchman feel about that?
Are they still gonna help after overhearing this conversation?

JAY:
Just pan over, and they're all standing there, confused.
Oh, no.

MIKE:
They just filmed him in his trailer before filming.
He's really dying.

RICH:
"He's got three more stages of the disease before he dies."
"He'll last another ten years."

MIKE:
"Just keep..."

JAY:
"Considering that he's already 90, that's pretty good."

MIKE:
"Just keep him away from the pizza."

RICH:
"Actually, the disease is slowing down his metabolism."
"He might, he might live a little bit longer, all said and done."

MIKE:
I wonder if he really was sleeping.
You, you get him all, you get him all prepped in the bed, you know, grandpa, grandpa nods off.

RICH:
Long day of filming.

MIKE:
Yeah.
"Here's your job, Michael."
"You just gotta lay there."
"I hope that..."
So he's gotta go to this dedication of a telescope, and then go after the supervillains that are gonna destroy the world.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
The telescope dedication is very important.

JAY:
Well, this is, you know, this is the struggle of leading a dual life.

MIKE:
Yep.
"We'll get to the, uh, criminals later."

JAY:
This is what you call "filler".

MIKE:
Isn't that the whole movie?

JAY:
That's, that's...
It kind of is, yeah.
Where they're like,
"We can'st just have, uh, action and toy commercials."
"We have to have scenes."
"So have 'em talk about stuff."
That's the movie.

MIKE:
Jay, the film's about family.
It's about family and learning to trust, trust your partner.

JAY:
"I'm sorry, Uncle."
It's weird that she just keeps call...

MIKE:
"Oh."
"I just farted again."
"Oh, my god."
"Alfred."
"Oh, dear god."
"If you keep farting like that, Uncle Alfred, I'm not gonna have sex with you anymore."

RICH:
Maybe that's why she wants to have sex with him.

MIKE:
What?

JAY:
What?

RICH:
She's into that.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
She, she just brings in more pizza.

JAY:
"Keep farting, Uncle Alfred."

RICH:
One Batgirl, Two Cups.

JAY:
Oh, no.

MIKE:
"You look so much like your mother, especially from behind."
Here we are at the telescope dedication.

JAY:
Yes.
Why are there sparks falling from the ceiling?
Like, are they still constructing the building?

MIKE:
I don't know.

RICH:
They're almost done.

JAY:
"We're close enough."

MIKE:
They're still building the set.
They had to set the...

JAY:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
Keep shooting.

JAY:
Oh, here's another scene with Elle McPherson.
This is, like, a scene where they worked in all the most useless characters into one scene.
Is that Michael Jai White next to Elle McPherson?
It looked like him.
He was in Spawn.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Where was, when was Spawn in relation to this?
Was Spawn earlier?

MIKE:
Spawn was, like, '97, I wanna say.

JAY:
Well, this is '97.
So right around the same time.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Probably around the same time.
I think Spawn was, like, a winter movie.

JAY:
Yeah, '97.
Okay.

MIKE:
And then this was a summer thing.
So Spawn probably came out later that year.

JAY:
Talk about bad comic book movies.

MIKE:
Oh.
Maybe, maybe her bangs hide her weird, uh, leaf...

RICH:
Mm...

JAY:
Ugh.

MIKE:
Leaf forehead?

JAY:
Is that what we're going for?

RICH:
Eh, whatever.

MIKE:
Why does she wanna know where the Bat-Signal is?
Does she do something with that?
I think Bane just smashes it.

JAY:
I don't remember.

MIKE:
And that's it.
Joel was well ahead of the fashion curve.
Those, like, obnoxious nerd glasses are popular now.

JAY:
Oh, poor Pat Hingle.

MIKE:
He got paid.

RICH:
They all made money for this.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Exactly.

RICH:
And that's the real tragedy.

JAY:
Not that it killed the Batman franchise, but...

RICH:
The Batman franchise is fine.

JAY:
Well, now it is.
It took a while.
Actually, what's weird, I was thinking about this.
Uh, the, uh, Batman Returns was only, like, seven or eight years after this.
And, like, I remember at the time...
It felt like a long time before there was, like, an attempt to reboot Batman.

RICH:
You mean Begins?

JAY:
What did I say?

MIKE:
Returns.

RICH:
Returns.

JAY:
Oh.
No.
Batman Begins.
Yeah.
I remember at the time, after this movie, it felt like a really long time...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Before they were...

RICH:
That's what I'm saying.
I mean, it really didn't kill the Batman fran-...
I mean, it only took 'em seven years to make another one.
Which, at the time, they weren't rebooting things every two months.

JAY:
Yeah.
I was gonna say, now it's, you know, we're getting another Spider-Man.
Like, they don't even wait anymore.

MIKE:
Mm-mm.

JAY:
It's like,
"If it fails, just start over!"
Like, we're probably gonna get a new Fantastic Four movie next year.

RICH:
Like, when, when Begins came out, at the time, it felt like,
"Well, it hasn't been that long since the last one..."

JAY:
I remember it felt like a long time to me.

MIKE:
Now it's weeks!

JAY:
But then again, I never saw this movie in the theater.
I had already abandoned the series.
So, maybe that's why it felt longer.
What are they doing?

MIKE:
Oh.
There's some stupid plot about, uh, satellites around the Earth?

JAY:
Oh, yes.

MIKE:
And I think they're, they're gonna bounce...

RICH:
They're gonna freeze-ogrify the satellites.

MIKE:
They're gonna freeze, yeah, the planet with the satellites.
And then they use it at the end to...
Oh, god.

JAY:
Well, here's the famous password, uh...

MIKE:
This is...

JAY:
Guessing scene.

MIKE:
This is the famous password guessing scene.

JAY:
And then the password turns out to be three letters long.

MIKE:
Now this is, this is a testament to both Joel Schumacher's direction and Alicia Silverstone's acting, is when she uncovers, uh, unlocks the password and uncovers the truth about Bruce Wayne, that he's Batman.
She just looks like she's laughing.
Smiling and laughing.
It makes no sense.
She should be, like, kind of, uh, inquisitive.

JAY:
She should just be confused...

MIKE:
Shocked, confused.
Yeah.

JAY:
Because the images that we're seeing don't make any sense.

MIKE:
No.
It's just pictures of, like, Batmobiles flying around.

MIKE:
Yeah.
But it's, it's like she has this maniacal laugh on her face, like she just read a hysterical joke.
And, and really, it should be like,
"What?"
"Oh, my god."
You know...
"He's Batman?"
"What is this?"
Like, but instead she just starts laughing and smiling.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
Like someone's tickling her.
It makes absolutely no sense.

RICH:
It's all, it's all fine.
Everything's fine.

JAY:
It's all fine because none of it matters.

MIKE:
Oh.
He's trying to act.
The, the, he looks down...
Look at George Clooney's face.
It's the oh-god-someone-just-farted-but-I'm-gonna-try-to-be-polite.

RICH:
He's the, he's the butler.
Does he have to keep changins his own sheets?

MIKE:
I told you, he puts the "butt" in "butler".

RICH:
"Oh, no."
"Not again."

MIKE:
"Oh, here's another one!"

RICH:
"Oh, I just changed those."

MIKE:
"I love you, old man."
"You've, you've, you served me your whole life."
"But I'm not gonna get you, like, a nurse or anything."

JAY:
No.

RICH:
"Keep cleaning my house."

JAY:
"I'm just gonna leave as you die in your bed."

RICH:
"You're 80 and you raised me."
"You're still my fucking butler."
"Get me wine."

JAY:
Oh, no.

RICH:
"You lived a servant."
"You're gonna fucking die my servant."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That is a subplot in this film.

JAY:
Yeah?

MIKE:
Batgirl is upset that, that Alfred was a slave, basically.
And, and she wants to free him from h-, his, uh, servitude to Bruce Wayne.
And then, that's why he asks him, he's like,
"Did you have a happy life?"
And he's like,
"I guess."

JAY:
I guess this was before people really understood the importance of password, uh, security.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
When your password is just three letters long.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Sitting on a picture right next to your computer.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.
Watch Alicia...

RICH:
And, and the secret this password is protecting is so huge.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Watch her face.

JAY:
Yeah.
Like, what is this shit?

RICH:
It's, like, it's the launch codes.

JAY:
Why, why, what is happening?
Like, things are just falling from the sky.

MIKE:
She's, like, laughing.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And smiling.
What, what is this?
And there's the logo from the movie.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Now she's smiling.

JAY:
Yeah.
She should look horribly confused.

RICH:
She should.
But I think they went for,
"Oh, this is fantastic!"

JAY:
It's supposed to be, like, whimsical, but it doesn't work at all.

RICH:
"This is amazing!"
And, yeah.
It fails.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
But it would be, like, if, like, the password for the nuclear launch codes was 1-2-3-4.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alfred, Alfred's old, you know.
He did, he...
"What's, what would be a good password?"

JAY:
Why, I mean...

MIKE:
"Pizza."

JAY:
Pizza?

MIKE:
She types in "fart".
"Gas".
"Pizza".
"Elderly".
"Piss in my pants".
And then it's Peg.

JAY:
"Depends".

MIKE:
"Depends".

JAY:
"Diaper".

MIKE:
"Diaper".

JAY:
Why...
We've been talking over the whole thing, so I'm sure there was some sort of explanation, but why did she go into that room to, and, and start...

RICH:
Because she needed to find out he was Batman.

JAY:
There was probably, like, one line to explain what she was doing.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I don't know why she's trying to break into his, his secret thing.
Because he's gonna, he wants her to give it to the other uncle.

JAY:
I know...
Yeah.
I know he mentions, like,
"You need to find Wilfred or whatever."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But...
I don't know.

MIKE:
Who cares.
And he made her a Batsuit, even though she didn't, he didn't even know she was coming.

JAY:
And she's...
Well, I'm assuming he made it for her after she showed up.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because he knew that she would find it eventually.
But he's, like, sick and on his deathbed.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He's...

JAY:
When did he make this thing?

RICH:
He's a slave.

JAY:
He has a crippling illness.

MIKE:
Maybe he made it in case Robin ever went the other way.
I don't know.
Does that make sense at all?

JAY:
In, in...
Well, no.
Because he does, he directly says,
"Hi, niece."
"You found us."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
"I made you a suit."
So it's specifically made for her.

MIKE:
That's true.

JAY:
He must've tried to, like, secretly get her measurements when she wasn't looking.

MIKE:
That's why he kept fondling her breasts?

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
She thought he was just a pervy old uncle.
But he was actually getting her sizes to make a Batsuit.

MIKE:
"I need to grab onto your buttocks."

RICH:
Alfred made it years ago before he knew that Bruce Wayne was gay.
"Maybe, you know, someday there'll be a wife."

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That explains why he kept trying to fondle Elle McPherson, too.
He thought maybe she would be the next Batgirl.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
He just wasn't interested in Elle McPherson.

JAY:
There's just a whole series of scenes cut out from this movie of Alfred being a creepy pervert and fondling everybody.

MIKE:
He kept trying to get Alicia Silverstone's measurements, but the farts kept her away.
"I gotta go, Alfred!"

RICH:
Is this, is this how a diamond laser would work?
A whole bunch of different segments?
Wouldn't you want one flat thing?

MIKE:
Rich.
Rich.
Stop talking now.
This...
Oh, my god.
You're talking...

RICH:
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let's talk about Alfred farting some more.

MIKE:
Alfred fighting makes more sense than this laser.
Oh, my god.
I hate him.
I hate everything in this movie.

RICH:
Oh, no.
The machine froze before it could shoot the laser.
That's why it failed.

JAY:
Why are there, like, icicles shooting up?
Like, stalagtites.
Or stalagmites?
Which one comes from the floor?

MIKE:
One comes up.
One comes down.

JAY:
Why are, why are they shooting up?
It's just ice.

MIKE:
Because it's cold.

RICH:
Because apparently he freezes air.
I don't, I don't know.

MIKE:
Rich has a scientific explanation for you, okay?

JAY:
Rich, you are good at coming up with scientific explanations for nonsense garbage writing.

MIKE:
Rich is very good at bullshit.

RICH:
I am full of it.

JAY:
Here...
Here we have Max Headroom-Alfred.

MIKE:
It's not Max Headroom-like.
It's just Alfred, isn't it?

JAY:
He glitches a few times, and it reminds me of Max Headroom.

MIKE:
Mm.
"I programmed my brain algorithms into the Batcomputer, and created a virtual simulation."

JAY:
This is just nonsense.

RICH:
"So that I can be a slave for eternity."

MIKE:
Oh.
Look at that, that, uh, graphic.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, no.

RICH:
"I designed a female Batsuit because that's what gets me off."

MIKE:
Oh, no!

JAY:
I guess, to be fair, we do get close-ups of her, her butt and boobs and, and crotch.

MIKE:
Well...

JAY:
So, everybody gets to see the pointless close-ups of anatomy.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
He was very reluctant to put that in the film.

MIKE:
No.
Joel Schumacher talks about that.
He says he was criticized for over-sexualizing both men and women in films.
In his films.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And, so, like, and he just, like, goes on and on about how attractive Nicole Kidman is.
I think he's just more like a visual filmmaker, as opposed to, like...

JAY:
He's just like,
"I wanna make everything, like, beautiful."

MIKE:
Yeah.
And he's like, he's like,
"People have criticized for over-sexualizing actors."
He's like,
"That's why they're there."
Because, like...
He's like...
No.
He was, like, very candid about it.

JAY:
Huh.

MIKE:
He's like,
"That's why you put attractive people in a movie because people wanna see that."
You know, and he was listing off, like, like, old, older actors.
You know, like...

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
From the past 1940's and 50's.
Like, and he's like,
"People wanna see beautiful people in movies, whether it's men or women."
And he's like, just,
"Fuck you."

JAY:
I mean, I guess that's true.
You can sexualize them to a point, but not to the point where it's, like, embarrassing.

MIKE:
Well, the, the close-up of...

JAY:
Like, do we really need, like, snap zooms on Batman's ass?

MIKE:
No.
That's over-the-top, of course, but...

RICH:
God.
Her hair is even crazier now.
Her hair is mutating.

MIKE:
She's in her giant lair.
Now it's, like, orange.

RICH:
Are we, are we out of things to talk about?
Are we, are we back to poop jokes?

MIKE:
She kind of looks like, like a drag queen here.

JAY:
A little bit.
Like, she's got a little bit of the Divine eye makeup on.

MIKE:
I was just gonna say that.
Yeah.
The, uh, she looks like Divine.

JAY:
Can you imagine this movie if Divine was still alive and they cast Divine as Poison Ivy?

MIKE:
They should've done that.

JAY:
That would've been great.

MIKE:
Poison Ivy should've really been an unattractive woman.
Or a transvestite.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because then you'd really see how her magical pheremone powers...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Unleashes.

JAY:
Like a sharp contrast.

MIKE:
Right.
Oh, wait.

RICH:
Liberace.

MIKE:
Oh, god.
Watch, watch...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
Here's the rubber lips.

MIKE:
Watch this.
He's, he, he bests her.

JAY:
He outwitted her.

MIKE:
Okay.
Here it comes.

JAY:
Yrrooom.

MIKE:
That's it.

RICH:
Oh.
They were supposed to both come off.
Oh, well.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
"We just got, we just got the top lip."

JAY:
"We're not gonna reset that."

MIKE:
You can see the bottom one start to peel off.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, he fucked it up.

JAY:
He's sort of stuck there.

MIKE:
"See ya!"
Oh, yeah.
She goes,
"See ya!"

JAY:
I think this was really why they introduced Batgirl is because they couldn't have Batman and Robin, like, fighting...

MIKE:
Beat up a woman?

JAY:
Yeah.
They couldn't have her punching, have them punching Poison Ivy.
But look at this, his cape here is like, it's like wired to his knees?

RICH:
Because he looks, he would look silly if the cape were hanging down.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
And now it just looks awkward and weird.

RICH:
Now it looks more silly.

JAY:
Yeah.
Oh, there's a part coming up where they did, like, the, the, uh, uh, the, the, uh, Star Wars thing with the Tuscan Raider.
You know, where they release the footage?

RICH:
Oh, yeah?

JAY:
There's a part like that with Chris O'Donnell, where he pops out of the water and then goes back under the water.

MIKE:
What?

JAY:
Uh, just watch.
I'll point it out when it happens.
And then they reuse the shot again a few shots later.
But first we have to get this, uh, fabulous girl power speech from...
It's...
Right here.
Look it.

RICH:
Whoa!

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
It's really bizarre because they don't even need that shot.
Just cut to him under the water.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's true.

JAY:
It's, it's very weird.

RICH:
They thought, they thought he needed to take a breath, I think.

JAY:
Maybe.

MIKE:
Maybe.
Yeah.
Because the, that...

RICH:
He's been underwater too long...

JAY:
They wanted some, they had to make it believeable.

RICH:
It's, it's not realistic enough in this movie of rubber icicles and giant plant monsters.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
We just shatter the realism that's happening all around us.
Now who made that thing?
Where did it come from?

JAY:
Bane made it.

RICH:
"Bane likes arts and craft."

MIKE:
"Will you make me a giant flower chair, Bane?"

JAY:
Okay.
What, what...
Oh, she actually says "curses", which is embarrassing.
But what's happening here?

RICH:
She's being eaten by a cabbage.

JAY:
But that was, like, that was, like, her throne.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.

JAY:
Why does it suddenly eat her?
Okay.
Here's that shot again.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But now it continues.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They need a shot where he goes back down, and they just had that.

JAY:
They just didn't have it, so they did that.

MIKE:
So that's the end of Poison Ivy, huh?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Is that the end of her character?
She falls...

JAY:
No.
She shows up at, in the, in Arkham Asylum in the end.

MIKE:
Right.
But she...
That's how they, they defeat her more or less...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Is she falls on her own chair...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it closes.

JAY:
And they don't handcuff her or turn her over.
They just leave her there in the hope that the plant doesn't burp her out, I guess?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Or she, she could just slip out of that opening.
That...her legs are sticking out.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
So, okay.
Well, that, that's good.

JAY:
That's that.

MIKE:
That's quality.
And...cut.
"Let's kick some ice."

JAY:
"Let's kick some ice."

RICH:
That's terrible.

JAY:
It is.

MIKE:
So...
Oh.
There he goes.
Now, once they freeze everyone, they have eleven minutes to thaw them out, Rich.
He tells Batman that earlier on in the film.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
When he freezes Robin at the very beginning.
For some reason, he tells the need to tell Batman that he has eleven minutes to save Robin.

RICH:
Well, he needs to let Batman know that it's possible to save Robin so he can be distracted.
That, that makes some amount of sense.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.
I guess.

MIKE:
Yeah.
So he could get away.
Although he could have just froze Batman, too.

JAY:
Look at that.
That's a telephone booth.
Those are thing that people used to use to make phone calls with.

MIKE:
That's right.
That's right.

JAY:
And that's a dog.
People used to have those, too.

RICH:
I gotta say, the people encased in ice doesn't, doesn't look that bad.

JAY:
Um, I'll have to see a few more.
Robin at the beginning looked bad.
And the, the rubber icicles flopping around looked kind of bad.
So he's just freezing Gotham.
What, what happens with the satellites?

MIKE:
Uh, he, the satellites beam around...
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Oh, wait.
Yeah.
Here the...
Okay.
"We're in a hurry."
"We have to stop Mr. Freeze."
But apparently they, I'm guessing, went back to the Batcave to get all these new toys -- I mean, vehicles -- right?

MIKE:
Uh, Alfred brought them?
Oh, wait.
Alfred's on his deathbed.

JAY:
Alfred's on his deathbed.

RICH:
He actually took...

JAY:
They changed costumes, too.
Like, it seems like if things are...
Oh, my god.
That's terrible.
It's like they built that to go over her little cowl.

MIKE:
Uh...

JAY:
Because she peels it off in a minute, and her cowl thing is underneath it.

MIKE:
They could've had time to go back to the Batcave...

JAY:
No, they...

MIKE:
To get more vehicles.

JAY:
They did go...
That's probably what they did it, but it seems like they should be in more of a hurry.

RICH:
He took the time to invent a Bat ice-car?

JAY:
Yeah.
These things are specifically designed to go on ice.

MIKE:
Uh...what?
He jumped...

JAY:
And these things are used for this one sequence, and then they're just gone forever.
Just long enough for 'em to, to make toys of.

RICH:
What?

JAY:
Oh.
The ice doesn't work on his shield.

RICH:
Why, why doesn't the shield freeze?
That doesn't make any sense.

MIKE:
It's specifically designed to deflect an ice beam, Rich.
Duh.

JAY:
All these machines, all these vehicles, were built just in case they encounter a supervillain, uh, whose power is that he freezes stuff.

RICH:
Or he built this all in the last, like, ten minutes.

JAY:
Oh, man.
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's why...

JAY:
It could be three days later, they finally finish building it, and Mr. Freeze just hasn't gotten to his plan yet.

MIKE:
That's why Alfred's fucking dying because he's overworked.
"Alfred, I need three vehicles right away."

RICH:
"But I'm dying, sir."

MIKE:
How does, like, a 90-year old man make all this stuff?
It's so stupid.

JAY:
And now, yeah.
Now Catwoman takes...
Or, Catwoman.
Batgirl takes off her cowl thing.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And she has the other mask underneath.

MIKE:
And she just throws it down a pit.

JAY:
Yeah.
Alfred spent weeks building that for her, and she's,
"Ehh, fuck this thing."

RICH:
Was that supposed to be actual images from the telescope?
What's being, you know, on, on the ceiling there?

MIKE:
Oh, he's got Batwarmers, too.
Th-, those are always useful.

JAY:
Yeah.
Everyone's just hopping around on wires.

MIKE:
"Eight minutes, and they're ice cubes forever."

RICH:
Somebody wrote that.

JAY:
Or did they?
Is that just, like...
I always wonder, like, when all this shit's happening and none of it makes any sense, if there's line when you don't see the actors actually talking, but it's, like, close-ups of monitors, if it's just ADR they made up to try and make things make sense.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Even in, even in ADR, somebody wrote that line.
"Eight minutes..."
"Eight minutes, and they'll be ice cubes forever."

JAY:
Now is this...
What is it, eleven minutes, you said?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Is that just the amount of time it takes before your body freezes to the point of you dying?

MIKE:
I, I would assume so.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And that's, uh, I don't know what that clock was.

JAY:
It's somewhere in the room.

MIKE:
"Tonight's forecast: a freeze is coming."
Oh, my god.
I missed that one, too.

RICH:
Is it special ice?
Because ice would just, like, destroy your cells.

MIKE:
Well, you'd suffocate first.
I'm assuming.

RICH:
It wouldn't even, it wouldn't even matter.
The ice crystals forming in your blood would rupture your cells.

MIKE:
Well, sure.
Yeah.
I mean, unless it just formed around you, but still, if, if you can't breathe air...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You would die in a couple minutes.
So the eleven-minute mark is very strange.

RICH:
That's a long fucking drop.

MIKE:
Well, this is, this is completely realistic compared to the end of Batman Forever.

JAY:
What happens there?

MIKE:
Uh, Dr. Chase Meridian and Batman...
Or what's his name, Robin?
They're both in tubes, and...

JAY:
Oh.
That's right.
And he, it, it, it's like,
"You have to, you can only save one of them."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Or some dumb shit.

MIKE:
But, and, and it shows, it shows, like, the pits beneath them.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And I always thought they were separate pits.

JAY:
Oh, and then they converge into one.

MIKE:
And then they're, they're in one.
They're falling, and it's, like, a hundred feet.
But they're falling for, like, twenty minutes.
He hooks her, and then he goes after Robin next.
And it's just, any kind of realistic threat has been completely deflated at that point.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Joel Schumacher in these movies has a thing for, like, wire work and falling.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, everyone's just constantly falling down.

MIKE:
Because it's a comic book, Jay.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
"In, in comic book, people jump around and fly around."
"I've heard of comic books."

RICH:
He's not the person that should've been directing these movies.

JAY:
Or is he, if the goal of the studio was just to make a toy commercial for children?

MIKE:
Well, here's Batman fighting Freeze.

JAY:
Kind of.
It's just sort of Freeze awkwardly swinging around as Batman jumps over him.

MIKE:
There's a little bit of a fight going on.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a fight.

MIKE:
Rich approves of the fight.

JAY:
All right.
Look at that giant comical tube...

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Coming out of the back of his head.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They were easily able to kick it.
It squirts out something.
His goo that makes him powerful.

RICH:
Yeah.
The Bane juice.

JAY:
Oh.
He just shrinks back down to normal.

RICH:
Instantly.
All that mass went to nowhere.

JAY:
Is there an explanation as to why he does Poison Ivy's bidding?

RICH:
Because he's a Monster Man.

MIKE:
He's been, he's been zombified to do your bidding.
Like, that was the guy's experiment was to create a mindless supersoldier.

JAY:
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
I guess that is explained.
But why Poison Ivy?

MIKE:
I don't know.

JAY:
Because she was there?

MIKE:
Because she was there.
That's the only reason.

RICH:
Somebody pointed this out online that, uh, Batman uses, like, the heat thing to beat Mr. Freeze.
But it doesn't really do anything.
He beats him by actually punching him.
He puts the heat thing on him...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And then he just hits him into the, the, the diamond thing.
So what do you need the heat thing for?
Just, just hit him into the diamond thing.

JAY:
Just, just, just punch him.

RICH:
Just punch him.

MIKE:
It made it look like he did something clever.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But you weren't able to actually recognize it.
It happened so fast, you know, you don't, you had no idea what happened.
"Oh, he did a thing."
"That's great."
Oh, no!

JAY:
The Batman mask should not be shot from that angle where you see those little nostril holes.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
It looks bad.

MIKE:
They don't care what angle they shoot the Batman costume in, or how they light it.
They just do whatever.

JAY:
"Batman, you're doing it!"

MIKE:
"You've lost, Freeze."
"Till next time."

RICH:
"You've unthawed some of the people, and you've burned others."

MIKE:
Yeah.
I guess if it's hot enough to melt ice within a minute...

RICH:
A second, yeah.

MIKE:
It would probably be pretty dangerous.
Everyone has skin cancer now.

JAY:
I would think so.

RICH:
Batman gets sued.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
They just leave that scrawny man there.

MIKE:
It's not his fault he's Bane.

JAY:
"Freeze in hell."

RICH:
Make sense.
Why don't you make sense?

JAY:
Movie, why don't you make sense?

MIKE:
Why are those two lab technicians so important that we keep cutting to them?

JAY:
Why is everything exploding?

MIKE:
Because the sun melted everything, and messed the structural integrity of...
I don't know.
What is that?

JAY:
"What is that?"

MIKE:
Oh.
That's a telescope falling.

JAY:
That's the telescope falling.

MIKE:
Oh.
They're gonna jump.
And then it's gonna take, they're gonna fall for 40 minutes.

JAY:
Wow, look at this.

MIKE:
Oh.
What?
"Grab onto my belt."
Isn't that Alfred's line?
Oh, no.
That was a very, very unexciting explosion.

RICH:
Then they were killed by the shrapnel.

JAY:
No.
He just leaves them on this rock.
"How are we supposed to get off of here?"

RICH:
"We're gonna freeze to death."

MIKE:
He forgots about 'em.
He just goes home.
"Oh, god."
And he wakes up in the middle of the night.
"Oh, fuck."
He comes back, and they're dead, and he just doesn't tell anyone.

RICH:
He turns on the news in the morning.
There's a story about these two lab technicians that died.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He goes,
"Oh, fuck..."
That's how the movie ends.

JAY:
"There is a way, but it would take a computer genius."
What does that mean?

RICH:
It doesn't matter.

MIKE:
To fix the circuits to make the thing work?

JAY:
Apparently, she's a computer genius?

MIKE:
And so is Robin.
Oh.
That's what she's going to school for in England.
Computer science.

JAY:
Oh.
That's why she was able to figure out the obvious password.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
Her Bat-helmet is gone now.
When did that happen?

MIKE:
She threw it off.

JAY:
She threw it off.
We pointed it out.

RICH:
I, I zoned, I zoned out.

MIKE:
She had it on for a minute.

JAY:
Hm.

RICH:
I zoned out and missed it.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She took it off and threw it down a pit.
Because she doesn't love her Uncle Alfred.
Oh, my god.

RICH:
Now he's gotta make another one.

JAY:
He's in that bed, like, have to,
"Ugh..."
Trying to sew.

RICH:
He's trying, now he's trying to sew this thick leather material, too.
Not just regular cloth.
He's, like, hurting his fingers trying to get the needle through.

MIKE:
He does it manually with a needle and a thread.
"Alfred, I need you to make my costume six inches thicker."

JAY:
Oh, there's some rubber icicles.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's where they're bouncing.

JAY:
Holy shit.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
Those costumes.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They're so gawdy and awful.
Oh.
He's still collecting money from something.

JAY:
As long as the dog's okay.

RICH:
People care about dogs.

JAY:
Whose dog is that?

RICH:
Wilfred's?

MIKE:
Wilfred.

JAY:
Now th-, this part here, when, when Batman's talking to Freeze, all of, uh, George Clooney's close-ups, I'm wondering if they were, like, re-shoots or additional shooting, because it looks like they did not care anymore.
Like, if you look at...
Not this.
When you get to his close-ups.
Because it's, like, you can see where the black makeup ends, and you can see, like, his regular skin under it.
And the suits all, like, wrinkled and weird.
And who filmed this by the way?

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
The cameraman?

JAY:
Like, we saw that fight happen.

MIKE:
He had it...

JAY:
Who is filming it?

MIKE:
He had it recording on his little device somehow.

JAY:
His little device that he...

RICH:
It was floating next to him.

JAY:
Okay.

RICH:
Invisible.

MIKE:
So, which close-ups are you talking about?

JAY:
We'll get to it.
It's, like, the tighter shot of him.
And you can see, like, there's just tons of wrinkles in the costume, like they just pulled it out of storage.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
And you can see where the black makeup ends, and it's like nobody cared anymore.

MIKE:
I really can't wait to see this.
I can't wait to see something that's terrible in this movie.

JAY:
Maybe it's...
No.
It's not this shot.

MIKE:
Is it every shot?

JAY:
I mean, every shot is terrible, yes, but...

RICH:
Maybe it's all blurred.

JAY:
Here.

RICH:
The Bat...

JAY:
Look it.
You can see where the black makeup ends.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And look at, like, his neck on the suit.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He looks like he's half-asleep, too.

JAY:
It looks like the suit isn't made of rubber.
It looks like it's made of foam or something.
Like, the way it wrinkles.

MIKE:
Hm.

JAY:
So maybe the headpiece was made of foam instead of rubber.

MIKE:
Maybe.
yeah.

JAY:
Instead of, like, thick rubber latex or something.

MIKE:
Oh, Rich.
There's the cure to McGregor's Disease.

RICH:
He's just got it in his gauntlet?

MIKE:
Yep.

JAY:
He keeps it, he keeps it in his arm-panel, where it's not safe at all.

MIKE:
It could easily get smashed or broken.

JAY:
Yes.
"Take two and call me in the morning."

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
Because he's a doctor.

RICH:
Wait.
Wait.
Is that the only sample?
What about everybody else with McGregor's Disease?

JAY:
All that matters is Alfred.

RICH:
Maybe they should just, maybe they should analyze this cure and, and reproduce it instead of giving both vials to...

JAY:
Yeah.
Look at, look at this suit here.

RICH:
90-year old dying butler.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
So he could die of something else next week.

JAY:
Ooh.
I wouldn't want some sort of neon goo going into my body.

MIKE:
"Here, Alfred."
"I got these from a fucking supervillain."
"I'm pretty sure they'll work."
It just looks like a dangerous chemical.

JAY:
Yeah.
Now why do they all look like they've been living on the streets?
They're, like, covered in soot.

MIKE:
Because they went through a tough fight, Jay.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
They went through a tough fight.

JAY:
Even though they're, they're faces were completely concealed, dirt somehow got under them.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They were clean before.

JAY:
Okay.
So here's Poison Ivy in Arkham Asylum.

MIKE:
Yeah-huh.
And does this have any purpose?

RICH:
Who, who loves her?

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
Who?
That doesn't make any sense.
She doesn't have a...
She didn't have a love subplot.

MIKE:
She's gotta do something with the flower, Rich.

JAY:
Yeah.
It's flower-related.
So...
Oh.
This is where they introduce, I think, uh, Mr. Freeze as, like, her cellmate.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I think the implication is that he kills her.

RICH:
And he still has his robot suit.

JAY:
They, they gave him back his robot suit for some reason.

MIKE:
Well, Batman said he can continue his research, and they were gonna go move the dead wife in the tube into Arkham Asylum's "laboratory".

JAY:
Oh, Jesus.

MIKE:
I guess Arkham Asylum has a science lab.

RICH:
I'm, I'm, I'm sure none of the crazy inmates will try and rape her.

MIKE:
No.
She's in, she's in a tank of water.

JAY:
Wait.
Wait.
There's pizza!

MIKE:
Oh, no!
Alfred's back to the pizza!

JAY:
Alfred got back into the pizza!

MIKE:
He's gonna get McGregor's Disease again!

JAY:
That old fool never learns.

RICH:
"Oh, no."
"We used the last two vials."
"We can't cure him again."

MIKE:
"Master Wayne."
"Can you get me some more of that blue shit?"
"I ate pizza."

JAY:
This is weird.
Like, Alfred was on his deathbed.
They gave him the, the chemicals or whatever.

MIKE:
Oh.
And now he's Hugh Hefner.

JAY:
"And now he's Hugh Hefner."
No.
Like, they're all waiting in another room like you would wait in a hospital waiting room.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But it's just them and him in his bed.
Like, wouldn't you wanna be there for him and, like, watch over him?

MIKE:
Not if he's, not if he's passing the gas like he was before.

RICH:
Look.
It's, it's noon.
It's time for Alfred to bring them tea.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh, yes.

RICH:
So they have to wait...

JAY:
"Where is that old fuck?"

MIKE:
They wait...

RICH:
They wait in the parlor.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
They're waiting for him to clean up the fucking mess in the living room that they made.

RICH:
They're waiting, they're waiting for him to clean his soiled sheets so he can bring them tea.

MIKE:
"And, Alfred, clean up the fucking pizza boxes everywhere."

RICH:
"I know you just had McGregor's Syndrome, but..."

JAY:
Why is there, like, strip club lighting in this parlor room?

MIKE:
Because Alfred's got his, uh, his Hugh Hefner outfit on.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
There's a bunch of bimbos come out and start dancing in a minute.
"This is now the Playboy Mansion, not, not Wayne Manor."

JAY:
"What happened to Elle McPherson?"
"Get her back."
"Bring in Vendela."

MIKE:
"That blue liquid had some Viagra in it."
Because it's blue.
You get it?
"It gave me a raging boner."

JAY:
That's what they're all looking at here, right?

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Everyone's horribly uncomfortable.
Except for George Clooney.
He keeps looking down at it.

JAY:
He's into it.
He doesn't care.

MIKE:
Alfred's boner comes out next, touches their hands.
He just said he's gonna need a bigger cave.
You know what that means.

JAY:
Oh.
Here's those, the cowl with the rubber ears that are wobbling.
This is the same shot that they added with Batman Forever on.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And it was even more obvious, the wobbling Bat ears.

MIKE:
Yep.

JAY:
So that's Batman and Robin.

MIKE:
One of the worst films ever made.

JAY:
It's, it's two hours of your life you'll never get back.
This movie is a fucking chore to sit through.
When you're not cracking fart jokes through the whole thing.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's very colorful.
Very, uh, lots of costumes and big sets and actions.
But at the same time, it's boring as fuck.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I said, it's like watching money burn on the screen.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
I remember I...
Because I didn't see this in theaters.
I avoided it.
I think I saw a couple little bits of it on cable here and there.
But I had always heard how terrible it was.
So I finally, me and a friend broke down and we were like,
"All right."
"Let's rent Batman and Robin."
"We'll just laugh through the whole..."
"We'll make fun of it through the whole movie."
And, like, maybe twenty minutes in, we were like,
"This was a horrible mistake."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And then it just got uncomfortable, and we got quiet and depressed.
I think we did finish it, though.
Just to, just to say we did.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
It's a pretty miserable experience.
"Project Consultant".

JAY:
"Project Consultant".
"Bob Kane".
Aww.

MIKE:
And, Rich, you said Bob Kane is a, is a fraud...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Essentially.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Why, how, why is that?

RICH:
Uh, because basically the real creator of Batman is this guy named Bill Finger.
Bob Kane's, like, original version is, like, entirely different.
I think he's wearing, like, a red helmet and, and I don't even know if there's a bat theme.
And Bill Finger came in and said,
"No, you gotta do this, this, and that."
"Make him like a bat."
"Give him, like, a bat cape."
"And make it dark."
"Make it mysterious."
And basically did everything that was Batman came from Bill Finger.
And then Bob Kane took all of the credit, and Bill Finger died penniless.

JAY:
Wow.

MIKE:
The, the story of comic book creators is, like, they're all secretly comic book villains in real life, right?
It's backstabbing and lying and credit-taking.

RICH:
Not necessarily with the creator.
And Bill Kane...
In, uh, Bob Kane's case, yes.
But usually it's, like, the, the, the, uh, the company.
The, like, DC Comics itself is the villain.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Like, like, uh...

MIKE:
Didn't those guys sell the rights to Superman for, like, fifteen dollars?

RICH:
Yeah.
They got, they got, basically they got nothing.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
And, and DC made billions of dollars over the years with Superman.
The family got jack shit.

MIKE:
And Stan Lee's a horrible fraud and a liar, too, right?

RICH:
Uh, I don't...
All I, all I can really tell you for sure with Stan Lee is that all of his classic collaborators all ended up hating him.

MIKE:
Well, that's fair.
Well, uh, does anyone else have anything to say about the Joel Schumacher classic, Batman and Robin?

RICH:
No.

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
Well, thank you for listening to our commentary on Batman and Robin.

JAY:
I hope we made it less of a miserable experience to sit through.

MIKE:
Thank you, and good night.
