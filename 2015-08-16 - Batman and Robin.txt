JAY:
Hello, and welcome to the Red Letter Media commentary track for...Batman and Robin.
Uh, I'm Jay.

MIKE:
I'm Mike.

RICH:
I'm Rich.

MIKE:
And this is a Joel Schumacher film.

JAY:
Oh, boy.
Is it ever.
And here we have Arnold Schwarzenegger getting top billing.
Which happened with, uh, Jack Nicholson in the first movie, too.
Because they're the same caliber of actor.
R
MIKE:
What would happen if they were both in a movie together?

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
See, this is shocking to me, because, you know, Arnold at this point, I mean, his star was kind of fading, right?
I mean, Terminator 2 was a few years before this.
A number of years before this.

JAY:
Yeah.
This was around the time of, like, Eraser.
And it was after Last Action Hero, which I don't think is a bad movie, but it was, like, a big bomb.
So, his star was fading, but i think he was still the biggest star in this movie.

RICH:
At the time, wasn't George Clooney a bigger star?
Because ER was hot shit.

JAY:
He, he was a big TV star.

MIKE:
He was a big TV star.

JAY:
But that's a different world.

RICH:
True.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Just ask, just ask Ray Romano.

JAY:
What are you talking about?
He had a, he had a great film career.
Remember Welcome to Mooseport?

MIKE:
That was a hit.

JAY:
So here we have butt.
Cock.
And that's butt.
Cock.
And that's how we're starting our Batman movie.

RICH:
You forgot nipples.
We gotta mention the nipples.
It's obligatory.

MIKE:
The famous nipples on the batsuit.

JAY:
The famous nipples on the batsuit.
That's the thing that everybody goes to when they talk about why this movie sucks.
And it's, like, that's the least of this movie's problems.

MIKE:
Right.
Right.
Joel, Joel Schumacher mentioned that in the commentary for Batman Forever.
He said nipples on the batsuit became an international thing.
Like, and he said,
"Everyone needs to get a life."
And he's right, you know?

JAY:
To a certain extent, he's right.

RICH:
Can we, can we defend Joel Schumacher for a little bit, because I know, I know...

JAY:
You can.

RICH:
He's capable of good movies.
He did Falling Down.
He did, uh, Lost Boys.
I love The Lost Boys.
I mean, is, is this movie really just kind of a studio monster, where they wanted campy, child-friendly Batman?

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
It's, well, it's, I think, I think they're equal to blame.

MIKE:
No.
I mean, Joel Schumacher to me, like Rich said, he's made a lot of good films.
A lot of varying films.
Like Falling D-...
Compare Falling Down to this.

JAY:
Oh, sure.
8mm, did anyone see that?

MIKE:
Yep.

JAY:
With Nicholas Cage.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That's a pretty dark film.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've seen that.
That was him?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That scene where he's burning the giant pile of child porn is, is very similar to the scene where George Clooney slides down the back of a dinosaur.
They're just, they're cinematic equivalents.

RICH:
See, the tragedy is, when you think of Joel Schumacher now, you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger dressed like Mr. Freeze making ice puns.

JAY:
Yes.
And you think of nipples on the batsuit.

RICH:
Yes.
And you think of neon.

JAY:
That's, that's, when everyone talks about Joel Schumacher, that's what they go to.

MIKE:
Yeah.
But he's just a, he's just a working man's director.
He's, he's just a guy who tells stories on the screen.

JAY:
I think he's kind of like a Brett Ratner-type, where he's just sort of a studio Yes Man.
He's had some better scripts to work with.
Like, some, like, ÃŒ'm not a big fan of The Lost Boys, but, I know a lot of people really like it.
I think a lot of that is due to the story, but...

MIKE:
Uh-oh.

JAY:
I don't know.

MIKE:
Al better cancel the pizzas.
He looks like he's having horrible gas.
"Oh, cancel the pizzas..."
Anyways.
Oh, this is very 1960's.

JAY:
Oh, god.
This, yeah.
Why is Commissioner Gordon in, like, a, like, a street cop uniform now?
Did he get demoted between movies?

MIKE:
No, that's...
He's got fucking four stars on his shoulder.

JAY:
But he never...
He just wore, like, a suit and tie in all the other movies.
He never had to wear any sort of uniform.

MIKE:
That's his dress uniform.
It's a police commissioner dress uniform.
Quit complaining about that.

RICH:
You've got, you've gotta recognize him as cop, because how often do we see Gordon in these movies?

JAY:
That's true.
He's, he's practically an extra in this movie.

MIKE:
Rich, the most, most of the audience is here to see Pat Hingle, okay?
Not Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone, or Uma Thurman.
They're here to see Pat Hingle, goddammit.
He's a fucking star.
Uh, so here's Arnold, uh, turning people into plasticine wax.
I mean ice.
I mean ice.

JAY:
I know there's a part towards the end of the movie where there's one giant ice skull, and you can see it, like, wobbling.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because it's rubber.
Yeah.
Arnold is, is terrible in this movie.
He's not a great actor to begin with, but he's...
I mean, everybody in this movie should be embarrassed.
But he's particularly bad.

RICH:
Well, I mean, what else do you do with this material?

JAY:
Well, that's the thing.
And we can talk about this when Uma Thurman comes up later.
But she seems to be going for it.
As far as the, the campy over-the-top acting, she seems to get that, and get that this is all a joke.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
But everyone else just seems kind of confused.
They're just sort of acting normal.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And George Clooney is not acting at all.
He's just being George Clooney, even when he's Batman.
Like, when he jumps down here, and he says,
"Hi, Freeze."
"I'm Batman."
Like, he doesn't even try to say it in any kind of threatening way.

MIKE:
It's tongue-in-cheek.
Yeah.

JAY:
And then he...
It's not even tongue-in-cheek, though.
He just kind of says it.

MIKE:
"Duh-duh, duh-duh."
"Wilma!"

RICH:
See, George, George Clooney is acting like this is near the end of his career, where he just doesn't care.
But this is, this is when he was a rising star.
Yet here he is, huge movie, phoning it in.
How weird is that?

MIKE:
I don't know if he's phoning it in.

JAY:
I, I think it's more that he just didn't know what he was supposed to do.

RICH:
He's supposed to be Bruce Wayne.
He's acting like George Clooney.

JAY:
Yeah.
No.
He's supposed to be Batman here, and he's acting like George Clooney.
Bruce Wayne...
George, George Clooney acting like George Clooney when he's Bruce Wayne in this movie...fine.
Like, this movie sucks, and there's no sort of dark element.
Or, or tortured soul element to, to Batman.
So if they just wanna have him play, like, generic playboy man, fine.
But at least have some distinction between that and Batman.

MIKE:
I'm find with his performance in this.
Because...nothing matters in this.
Like, there is nothing that's, that's of any consequence.
Like, this scene is totally out of the 1960's Batman.
Like, wh-, wh-...
I can just see some studio person going,
"What is Mr. Freeze's, uh..."
"He's gotta have, uh, uh, henchman."
"What are they..."
"Hockey players."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Because cold."
And, like, uh...

JAY:
"Because cold."

MIKE:
Where do these people come from?
There's, no, you know...

JAY:
Yeah.
He did that in the last...
They did that in the last Batman movie, too, where everyone just has henchman, and why?
They tried to give some sort of motivation for it in the, the Tim Burton ones.
Like, why these characters would have, you know...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
People that would help 'em out, or why they'd have henchman.
But here, it's, nothing matters.

RICH:
My, my theory is that some, some executive that was only familiar with the, the 60's Batman, and grew up with Adam West and was just confused by the Burton movie...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And he,
"Why isn't Batman camp?"
"Where's the ka-pow sound effect?"

JAY:
Was it George Lucas?
Was he in charge of this movie?

RICH:
Yeah.
It was George Lucas.

JAY:
Okay.

RICH:
"Where's, where's the ka-pow sound effect?"
"Robin's a funnier character than we've ever had before."

JAY:
Yeah.
That's sort of confusing, though.
The idea that a studio executive would be like that because, generally, it's, like, movie's a big hit, we want to replicate that exactly.
And the Tim Burton movies are, are dark.
Are darker, anyway.
In, in comparison to the Nolan ones, they're not.
For the time.
So how do you go from that to this?

MIKE:
To, to be fair, Batman, 1989 Batman was a huge hit.
Great movie.
Batman, uh, Returns was not so well-received.
It was a little muddled.
I remember...

JAY:
It did well, but I don't think it was...

MIKE:
It did well, but it was definitely a downward dip...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
For Tim Burton, because I remember seeing that, and it was like,
"Oh, you know, Catwoman's in it."
"Um, the Penguin."
"Neat."
You know?
And then I watched it and I remember, like, feeling, like, two villains is too much.
It's too muddled.
It got...
I, I don't even remember anything about it, really.

JAY:
Oh.
See, I liked Batman Returns.
It doesn't...
It's not a good Batman movie, but then again, I don't think we've ever had a good Batman movie.
We've just had good movies that Batman happens to be in.

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
Um...

MIKE:
So it, it's almost like, like they wanted to take it in a different direction, and why not go...

JAY:
Yeah.
You can see...
I mean, I rewatched Batman Forever probably since the theater, uh, in preparation for doing this commentary.
And it's almsot as bad as this.
I didn't remember it being quite that bad.
But it still retains a little bit...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Of the elements from the Tim Burton ones.
A little bit.
There's still Bruce Wayne's kind of tortured.
Um...

RICH:
There was the wobbling.
There was the wobbling icicle.

JAY:
Oh.
There was one wobbling icicle.
There's more.

MIKE:
The, the...

JAY:
We're not done yet.

MIKE:
The wire work in this movie is just atrocious, by the way.

JAY:
But, Mike, it's a comic book.

MIKE:
Oh, it's a comic book.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's an infuriating thing that Joel Schumacher would constantly say in his commentary tracks.
He doesn't seem to understand the difference between a movie and a comic book.

JAY:
He's not saying it's a comic book movie.

MIKE:
Right.
He says,
"Tommy Lee, this is Tommy Lee Jones' first comic book."
And you're like,
"What?"
He, he also said something, like, uh, he's like,
"This, there's a little bit of, there's, uh, more characterization and depth to these characters than there, there is in a comic book."

JAY:
Oh, my god.
He said that about these movies?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's, like, I, obviously Joel Schumacher does not read comic books or have any i-, any understanding of the source material or anything.
Um, or respect, I should say.
Not that you should.
But, because like Rich says, comic books are made for four-year olds.
Right, Rich?

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
I say that all the time.

MIKE:
Well, give us a little b-...
Oh, my god.
This suddenly became an Austin Powers film.

JAY:
Yeah.
This is very much like the Dr. Evil's escape pod or something.

RICH:
And what, what backstory do you want?
I mean, there's not much relevant.
I mean, you could, you could argue that this is a, a throwback to, like, 50's, 40's-era Batman with Robin that was a bit sillier.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
But I think, I think at this time, uh, the fans were enamored with, like, The Dark Knight Returns.
80's, 80's Batman, when Batman started to get dark.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And, and, a, a return to camp was not at all welcomed by, uh, anybody in the comic book community at that point in time.

JAY:
Well, I don't think he was welcomed by anybody, because this movie didn't do well.
I think people went to Batman Forever because the first two were popular.
And you're like,
"Okay, we'll see this new one."
Uh, Jim Carrey's in it.

JAY:
And he was...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
The hot ticket at the time.
And then you get to this one, and it's just taking the worst elements of Batman Forever, and just amping 'em up.

MIKE:
Well, it, it, they went with a diff-, a slightly different direction with Batman Forever.
A little more goofy.
I, I hate Tommy Lee Jones in that movie.

JAY:
Yes.
That's the worst, probably, villain performance in any comic book movie.

MIKE:
In any movie.

JAY:
And I like Tommy Lee Jones.
He's a great actor.
But, man.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Worse than George Clooney in this?
I mean, they're not even trying.
Not even trying.

JAY:
Ugh...

MIKE:
Well, Tommy Lee Jones is trying too hard, and he has no idea what he's doing.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Jim Carrey, you give him the whacky psychopath role, he does fine.
Uh, he's over-the-top, but, you know.
That's Jim Carrey.
They needed, they needed Two-Face to be, like, more sinister.

JAY:
A contrast to that?

MIKE:
Yeah.
More sinister.
More stoic.
More strange.
But instead, he's, like, he's, like, laughing hysterically.
It's, it's just awful.
But Joel Schumacher makes Batman Forever.
And like you said, Jay, people go to see it.
"It's the third Batman movie."
"There's a new Batman."
"Neat."

JAY:
I, I think it was the highest-grossing of any of these.

MIKE:
Oh, sure.

JAY:
I think.

RICH:
Really?

JAY:
I think so.
I could be wrong.
Maybe not more than the first Batman.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But I'm not positive.

MIKE:
It's, it's setting the stage for disaster because the success gave Joel Schumacher and the producer, I forget his name on this, like, carte blanche to just go hog wild.

JAY:
Yes.
Well, also work in elements of the movie that are specifically there just to sell toys.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
There, there's an element of that, too, where it's like,
"Oh, now they're, they're on surfboards flying through the sky."
"We can make a toy of that."
You know?

MIKE:
I don't remember too many toys from this.
Were there a lot?

JAY:
I, apparently there was.
Because that was...
Joel Schumacher is very candid about saying that, too.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
How they would come up to him and say,
"Here's toys."
"Work these into the movie."
"And then we're gonna sell the shit out of them."

RICH:
How does Mr. Freeze have butterfly wings?

JAY:
Because he was anticipating this happening, Rich.
You gotta be prepared.
Everybody is prepared for everything all the time in these movies.

RICH:
He was anticipating having to leave the museum in a rocket ship?
And that the rocket ship would, would explode midair, and he'd have to jump out with butterfly wings?

MIKE:
Hey, for some reason, Batman and Robin both had ice, uh, blades built into their shoes.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And at the end of...
Well, that's a different movie, but I was gonna say, at the end of, uh, Batman Forever, Batman just happened to bring along 100 coins that are similar to...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
That he just throws up in the air.

MIKE:
"I have these!"

JAY:
Where was he storing those?

MIKE:
In his buttcrack.
That's why they kept sh-, that's why they show his butt in the beginning.
It was foreshadowing.

JAY:
Oh.
It was foreshadowing.
Okay.

RICH:
That's, that's at least more acceptable because Batman would know Two-Face's little...

MIKE:
Oh, shut up!

RICH:
Thing with the coin.
And you could...
That, that's something that he could logically prepare for.

JAY:
That's true.

RICH:
To confuse him.
That makes some sense.
You can anticipate that.
You can't anticipate needing ice skates at a museum robbery when you don't know who Mr. Freeze is before this.

MIKE:
That's true.
That's true.

JAY:
That's true.
Yeah.
They don't know Mr. Freeze at this point, right?
He's not, like, a known villain...

MIKE:
Nope.

JAY:
In this movie yet.

RICH:
I don't think so.

JAY:
Or in this world.

MIKE:
Nope.
Commissioner Gordon tells him about it on the way.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Maybe Batman just really likes ice skating.
He just has it built in for his own recreational purporses.

MIKE:
That's possible.
Yeah.

RICH:
You know, between, between crimes, you gotta do something.
I mean, there's not, there's not a supervillain robbing a bank every night.
There's some nights where you're just walking around waiting for someone to get mugged, and it just doesn't happen.
Just, yeah.
Just go over to the lake, and start skating.

MIKE:
That's true.
Now where are they?
Is this his lair?

JAY:
No.
They went down...
They explained it...

MIKE:
Oh.
He fr-, froze it.

JAY:
In a bad bit of ADR.

MIKE:
It's, like, the sewer.

JAY:
Yeah.
Something like that.

MIKE:
He's freezing the pipes, or something, and, uh...
Oh, my god.

JAY:
"The day is mine," he says.

MIKE:
"I'll kill you next time."

JAY:
Yeah.
They gave Mr. Freeze the worst dialogue in this movie.

MIKE:
Uh, just him?

JAY:
The first...
Well, I mean, he gets all the ice puns.
But also, like, at the beginning of the movie, he says,
"Kill the heroes."

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And I remember that really bothering me.
Because it's, like, it cements the fact that this Batman franchise is now aimed at six-year olds.

RICH:
Can you imagine how dull it would be to be a superhero?
Like, 99.9% of the time.
Because, because it's not like you walk down the street, there's always a mugging.
I mean, you're gonna go, like, like, months between stumbling onto a crime.

JAY:
Apparently, not in this universe.

RICH:
No, not in this universe.

JAY:
There's always things happening.

MIKE:
See, that, that...
Can we talk about supervillains and Batman?
Like, okay.
Batman has no superpowers, per se.
He, he's a wealthy guy with lots of toys and gadgets.
I like Batman if he's foiling regular criminals.
I don't like any of the villains in Batman.
They're all too whacky for me.
Do you know what I'm saying?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And that's what I always, like, when you, when you're saying a, a supervillain, or a superhero would be bored, I always think Spider-Man would be bored.
Because Spider-Man has a legit superpower.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
But then, conveniently, there's always, like, a supervillain that just kind of creates himself.
That's, you know, that's...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's, comes out of nowhere.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's one thing I really liked about the X-Men movies, is they never had that villain of the week mentality.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Where it's, like, every movie has to introduce at least one new villain.

MIKE:
That's true.

JAY:
Those are, those are more about, like, a power struggle between, you know, the difference, uh...

RICH:
Talents.

JAY:
Mentalities of, yeah.
Of what, you know, how people feel about their mutant powers.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Or, yeah, people with superpowers fighting other people with superpowers.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Which is a different brand.

JAY:
Yeah.
Where it's, like, a moral dilemma.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
And this is, this is villain of the week.
And that really started with Batman, uh, uh, Returns.

JAY:
That's the interesting thing, is it started with Batman Returns.
We had the Penguin and Catwoman.
And it's continued to this day.

RICH:
You can do Batman well without supervillains, too.
Like, uh, Year One does that.

JAY:
Not in the movie form.
No one will accept it.
You have to have...

RICH:
Probably, probably not.

JAY:
You have to have some sort of crazy villain.

MIKE:
Well, because that's the marketing, uh, element of it is,
"So-and-so..."
"Danny DeVito's playing the Penguin!"

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Oh, Danny DeVito's the Penguin!"
"That's great!"
"Uma Thurman is, uh, Poison Ivy."
It's just, like, you need that.
You can't just have Batman, dark Batman story.

RICH:
The early episodes of Batman: The Animated Series, there were episodes where he just flatout just fought mobsters.

JAY:
Yeah?

RICH:
Yeah.
Then, then, then the executives were like,
"We want, we want supervillains."

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It should always just be the Joker.

RICH:
That's, that's...

JAY:
That's why they keep coming back to the Joker.

RICH:
That's kind of Batman's major flaw.
It...
The Joker is just too good a villain that any, anything less than the Joker is a letdown.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, I don't know about that.

JAY:
I mean, we are about to get Bane.

RICH:
That's not Bane.

JAY:
But that's Bane.
This is Tom Hardy's first, uh, time playing Bane.

RICH:
This is monster man who also happens to be wearing a mask.

MIKE:
Those, those props are terrible.

JAY:
Yeah.
This is such a bizarre movie because it, it simultaneously looks super expensive and super cheap.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean...

JAY:
This movie, it's barely a movie.
It's like watching money burn on screen.

MIKE:
They, they did not put a lot of budget into the science lab.
This is just, like, cheap tubes from, uh, a hardware store.

JAY:
Well, what more do you need?
They're doing science experiments.
You use tubes.

MIKE:
The comical, like, flasks with the colored liquid in them.
You know.
It's just terrible.

JAY:
Well, here we have John Glover as the mad scientist man.
Who is, of course, Daniel Clamp in Gremlins 2.

MIKE:
He looks really bad.

JAY:
Oh.
I think that's how they made him up for the movie.

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
Yeah.
He, he looked much worse before that.

MIKE:
Duh-duh, duh-duh, duh, duh, bum.
Why does he...
Oh.
He creates Bane to sell him to world governments as a super soldier.

JAY:
Yes.
And Uma Thurman just happens to wander in at the exact moment.

MIKE:
They happen to work in the same lab.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's...

JAY:
Well, she was in the other room, and she was conveniently, uh, talking into a tape recorder that explains all of her motivation and what's happening.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That's kind of a theme in this whole movie.
If you're a fan of movies where characters talk out loud to themselves about exactly wh-, how they're feeling...

MIKE:
Well, she's gotta explain all of her experiments into her tape recorder in case she forgets.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
This is a prequel to Still Alice.

JAY:
Still Ivy?

MIKE:
Still Ivy.
And no matter what happens, if you fall into a vat of, of freezing cryogenic liquid that would just kill you instantly, you just become a supervillain.
Because if horrible chemicals pour all over you, you just become a supervillain.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
It's real easy to become a supervillain.

RICH:
There was, there was an Onion article that was like an obituary for Peter Parker, a, a, a high school kid who died of cancer.

MIKE:
Because he was bit by a...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Radioactive spider.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
Uma Thurman really is the only one that kind of comes out of this movie unscathed because she knows exactly what it is.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And what was she...
This was '97.
So this is post-Pulp Fiction.

MIKE:
Yep.

JAY:
So she's somewhat well-known at this point.

MIKE:
Oh, no.

JAY:
Uh-oh.

RICH:
Was she ever huge?

JAY:
Ehh.
Maybe Kill Bill would be the closest.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
God, yeah.
Fuck, yeah.
I completely blanked on Kill Bill.

JAY:
I mean, she's never been, like, uh...
Oh, god.
I don't know.
Who's a big female star?

RICH:
Kathleen Turner?

JAY:
Oh, my god.
How old are you?

MIKE:
Now she's a big female star.

JAY:
Kathleen Turner, you mean?

RICH:
Ba-dum, dum.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She looks pretty rough.

JAY:
So, so the chemicals are strong enough to burn a hole in the ground, I guess, right?
But they just give her superpowers.

RICH:
They only melt concrete.

MIKE:
They, well, they give her magical pheromone dust power.

JAY:
Okay.
That, that makes sense.

MIKE:
Oh, he's thawing him out.
Oh...
Yes.
So here's Mr. Freeze's backstory.

JAY:
The security cameras in his, uh, lab, uh, look like cinematic, but...

MIKE:
There's someone filming there.

JAY:
I wonder if that was, like, uh, like, uh, a scene.
An actual scene in the movie.
Like, maybe it was the opening or something.

MIKE:
Oh, possibly.

JAY:
And then they just reused it, repurposed it for this.

MIKE:
So there he falls into a tank.
There's just, there's just an explosion for no reason.
Okay, that liquid is 50-below.
But somehow he survived.
Uh...

JAY:
And that's our explanation.

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
"But he survived somehow."

MIKE:
So he has to remain, um, at zero degrees...
Oh, no!

JAY:
Ugh...
It's all just so embarrassing.
Look at these graphics.

MIKE:
I just wonder, uh, how superheroes, like, or supervillains, what, what he, what his process was out of he got out of that tank, you know?
And he's gotta get his wife there.
I'm sure the police showed up.
And emergency people.
Then he's gotta build his lair, and get all...

JAY:
He's gotta build that suit.

MIKE:
He's gotta make the suit.
Where does he get the money from?
That's one thing about Spider-Man 2 I enjoyed, was that Doc Oc, like, he went around and stole money from a bank...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
From banks and set up a lab in, in, like, a rundown dock, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He didn't just magically have, like, a secret laboratory with all this technology for no reason.

JAY:
Yeah.
Well, and that's the difference because...

MIKE:
At least they tried.

JAY:
There, there are some people that don't like the Raimi Spider-Man movies because they think they're too campy.
But it's, like, they find, I think, a good balance, you know?
Because the, the, going too far with camp, you end up with this.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And it's just the worst.

MIKE:
It's good entertainment for, for little kids, I guess, right?

JAY:
What?
This movie?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
I guess.
I mean, they can kind of follow what's going on.
There's too many subplots in this movie, though, where, that just get lost.
I remember rewatching this, you know, in preparation for this commentary, and Alicia Silverstone is introduced, and then she disappears for 40 minutes.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And she comes back, and you're like,
"Oh, that's right."
"She's in this."

MIKE:
That, that was the big...
I mean, not that that was the only thing that was wrong with this movie.
But squeezing in Batgirl was just stupid and pointless.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's, like, um, the movie's called Batman and Robin.
Like, just focus on them.
You don't need Batgirl in this.
It's just so dumb.

JAY:
But then you can make another action figure.

RICH:
It's...
Yeah.
Exactly.
It's another action figure thing.

JAY:
And that's, that's the goal of this movie.
It's not tell a, a competent, exciting Batman and Robin story.
It's just to sell toys.

RICH:
Did they ever make an Alfred action figure?

JAY:
I hope so, because I would feel very bad, uh, for the actor that plays Alfred if they didn't.

MIKE:
What's his name?

JAY:
His, his name is Michael Gouch, I think?

MIKE:
No.
I think it's pronounced Michael "Go".

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But now he's Michael "Gone".
Because he's dead.

JAY:
Wow.
That was good timing on that joke, just as he disappears.

MIKE:
Yep.
And watch Chris O'Donnel's career disappear in the next scene.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's something to point out, is, is, starting with Batman Forever, and it definitely continues with this, where they're not casting people that are right for the roles.
They're just casting who's super big at the time.

RICH:
Is, is the amazing thing about this movie, how many people's careers survived?

JAY:
That's true.
That's true.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Everybody...

RICH:
It didn't kill George Clooney, which is kind of amazing.

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, he was in Dusk Till Dawn, but this was his big thing.
And, yeah.
This is the kind of thing that could kill a career.
But I think it's just the, the charisma of George Clooney preservered.

RICH:
"I just like him so much."
"It doesn't matter."
"Put him in something else."

JAY:
What did he do after this to kind of redeem himself?

RICH:
Three Kings?

MIKE:
Ocean's Eleven?

RICH:
Ooh, yeah.

MIKE:
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure my George Clooney-ology.

RICH:
Yeah.
Three Kings is a bit later.
It was 2000?

JAY:
That was shortly after this.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
Let me see.

RICH:
That was, that was 2004 or something, maybe.
Yeah.
I'm completely wrong.
Forget me.

MIKE:
I don't remember anything past yesterday.
I'm sorry.
So, anyway...

JAY:
Oh.
He did The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman right after this.

MIKE:
Oh, god.

JAY:
But, then he did Out of Sight, the Steven Soderbergh movie.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Which is a good movie.
And then Three Kings.
So...
So he bounced back by not doing anymore big budget schlock right after this.
Just making quality movies by real filmmakers.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Clooney, Clooney's a good actor.
He's charismatic.
He's likeable.
He's got that kind of, that charm to him.
Like, I saw some interviews with him about this movie.
And he's, he's very tongue-in-cheek and candid.

JAY:
Self-deprecating.

MIKE:
A little self-dep...
Yeah.

JAY:
He knows, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
He's not doing the, like,
"This movie's gonna be a really great adventure story."
He doesn't care.

JAY:
Oh.
Are you talking about interviews from the time?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
From the time.
Still, he, he's...

JAY:
I thought you were gonna say, like, in retrospect, of course he would talk shit about 'em, but...

MIKE:
No.
He wasn't negative.
But he was more just like,
"Ehh..."

JAY:
He was just whatever?

RICH:
He didn't quite pull a Josh Trank?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Or the one I always think of is Dennis Miller.
I saw him on The Tonight Show to promote, uh, The Tales from the Crypt movie, Bordello of Blood.
And this was, like, days before it was opening.
And he was flat out saying it's garbage and don't go see it.
It was like,
"That's amazing."
Okay.
So, here, uh, Poison Ivy, she finds this beaker or whatever that has Wayne Enterprises on it.
And that's her entire motivation.
Just on a whim, she happened to notice that logo.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And that's her entire motivation for becoming a villain for the rest of the movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Like, what if she didn't notice that logo?
What would she be doing right now?

RICH:
Well, she's crazy now.

MIKE:
Well, it is revealed that Wayne Enterprises is funding her, their whole laboratory.
But I, I don't know if she knows that.

JAY:
She just sees that beaker and is like,
"Oh, I guess that's who's responsible."

MIKE:
It's, like, I dunno.
Does she show up at the Pyrex, uh, uh, world headquarters?
You know what I mean?

RICH:
Who would wanna be Mr. Freeze's henchman?
How do you...

JAY:
It looks, it looks pretty miserable.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Makes you sing.

RICH:
It's, like, that's another thing that always confused me.
How does the Joker ever get henchman?
I mean, he, he goes around killing people with, like, gas.
There's no profit in that.

JAY:
It's explained in the first movie.
It's, it's Jack Palance's people, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
And then he kills Jack Palance or whatever, and kind of takes over.

MIKE:
In the Nolan ones, it's, like, mentally, mental patients, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's kind of a stretch there.
Finding a lot of mental patients who just happened to be willing to go along with him.
That's a lot of mental patients.

MIKE:
I, I guess.

JAY:
At least it's something.
Here, it's like,
"Who are these guys?"

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
"Why would they follow him?"

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
So, like, very...

JAY:
And that was...
Oh, that was just Vivica A. Fox who showed up for five seconds for no reason.
Who was also, uh, a co-star of Uma Thurman's in Kill Bill.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.

JAY:
And later in this movie, Jesse Ventura shows up.
Did you even notice him when you rewatched it?

MIKE:
No.
No.

JAY:
Well, he plays a prison guard.
And so it's a little Predator reunion.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
And then at the end of the movie, the Predator shows up.

MIKE:
I was just gonna ask that, is the Predator in this?

RICH:
You know they did a comic book, Batman Versus Predator?

JAY:
Really?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
What haven't they done a versus to in comic books?

RICH:
Licenses.

JAY:
Didn't they do something with Archie?
Like, Archie and something weird.

RICH:
They've done, they've done a couple weird Archie ones.
They did Archie Meets the Punisher.

JAY:
Does he violently murder Jughead?

RICH:
He's, he's trying...
No.
He mistakes Archie for, like, a criminal.
Because Archie looks just like this mobster that the Punisher is trying to kill.
I haven't read it, but I know it's the Punisher trying to kill Archie.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
That needs to be a feature film.

JAY:
So Mr. Freeze's wife is played by Vendela.
Do you guys remember Vendela?

MIKE:
Uh, no.

JAY:
She was a big model at the time.
I think it was a Sports Illustrated thing.
But they cast her in this.
They cast, uh...

MIKE:
Elle McPherson.

JAY:
Elle McPherson.
So just whoever was, was a popular supermodel at the time, throw 'em in the movie.

RICH:
The, the tragedy is that at the time...
See, I mean, Mr. Freeze is originally just, almost just, just a complete schlock character.
Just a freeze gimmick guy.
But around this time, before this movie, they were turning him into, like, a soulful, tragic character.

JAY:
Oh, okay.

RICH:
And then they cast Arnold Schwarzenegger throwing out ice puns.

JAY:
I, I'm gonna...
He's a pretty soulful, tragic character in this movie, Rich.
I mean, his wife is frozen.
That's pretty sad.

MIKE:
Uh-oh.
Alfred was in the bathroom.

JAY:
That, those pizzas again.

MIKE:
Should've cancelled those pizzas.
"Sorry, Master Wayne."
"I was taking a dump."

JAY:
Here we have the best performance in the movie.
Uh, Alicia Silverstone.
Just a great, great actress.

MIKE:
Oh, oh, yeah.
She's brilliant.
She's, she's one for the ages.
She's...

JAY:
She looks like she's had a stroke.

MIKE:
Oh...

JAY:
Her mouth is...

MIKE:
Oh, my...

RICH:
Would you say she's "clueless"?

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Oh, I was wondering when that was gonna happen.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Yeah.
But that's a case of, they didn't cast...
I mean, first of all, Batgirl shouldn't be in this movie.
But they didn't cast, like, anyone that would be right...
They just cast her because she was super huge at the time.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
That was the formula.

JAY:
Chris O'Donnell was big at the time.
Uh...

MIKE:
It's a demographic thing.

JAY:
Yeah.
Exactly.

MIKE:
"I don't wanna see that."
"I'm a 14-year old girl."
"I don't wanna watch Batman and Robin."
"Oh, the Clueless girl's in it?"

JAY:
That's the most accurate impression of a teenage girl I've ever heard.

MIKE:
Thanks.

RICH:
Well, the formula was just cast the hottest actors...

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
And throw 'em in the movie.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
And the movie will make money.

JAY:
It's, it's products.
This is, this is not a movie anymore.
This is product.

MIKE:
There's a touching story about family...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And...

JAY:
I wanted to mention that, too.
That's a weird thing that they decided that that's what this, the theme of this movie would be, is family.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Why?

MIKE:
Because that's what Batman's all about.

RICH:
Because there's so many fucking characters.
What else do you do?

JAY:
I guess.

MIKE:
And I think Michael Gough was like,
"I want to be done with this crap."

JAY:
"Kill me."
"Kill me please."

MIKE:
There's a little bit where he's trying to locate his, his, um, his brother?

JAY:
Wilfred!

MIKE:
Wilfred?
Yeah.

JAY:
His brother's name is Wilfred.

MIKE:
So they could replace Alfred with Wilfred.
But the, but the funky thing is, um...
I mean, spoilers if you haven't seen this movie.
Um, Alfred has some kind of disease.
McGregor's Syndrome...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or some shit like that.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's what it's called.

MIKE:
And it's the same thing that Arnold, Arnold's wife has.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Who's floating in the tank.
And Arnold found the cure for Stage 1 McGregor's Syndrome.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
And so Alfred's, like, in, on his deathbed, and he's, like, 140-years old.
And then at the end of the film, they use, uh, Mr. Freeze's research to save, uh, Alfred.
It's like,
"I thought you were planning to kill him off so that you could replace him."
"Oh, you've, you've cured him so he could live for another week."
"And then die of old age."
"Good job, Batman."

JAY:
It's the closest thing this movie has to any sort of emotional element is,
"Oh, Alfred might die."

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then he doesn't.

JAY:
And then he doesn't.

MIKE:
"I'm back, sir."
"Oh..."

JAY:
Correct me if I'm wrong -- I don't remember exactly -- but this entire scene here, like, they're trying to have a little touching scene between the two of 'em.
But isn't the entre point of this scene just that she realizes that Alfred's...
Is that his wife in that picture?

MIKE:
Yeah.
I think so.

JAY:
Uh, yeah.
Or, or Wilfred's wife, or something.

MIKE:
I think that's her aunt.

JAY:
But her nickname is Peg.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Or, or short name is Peg.
And that's what the password is later in the movie for Alicia Silverstone to hack into his computer...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
And discover all the Batman shit.
That's pretty much the only...

MIKE:
Where she discovers his treasure trove of porno.

JAY:
Yeah.
But that's pretty much the only point of this scene, right?

MIKE:
Well...

MIKE:
Well, and to show that they're, they're very awkwardly close to each other in a very strange, sexual way.

JAY:
I was gonna, I was gonna say....
You were talking, so I didn't want to interrupt you.
But at the beginning of that scene, we were watching this with subtitles, and she came in and s-, the subtitles said,
"I came to tuck you in."
But I just glanced at it, and I thought it said something else for a minute.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
"Uncle Alfred, I came to fuck you."

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
Alfred puts the "butt" in "butler".
You know?
So here, Alicia Silverstone, -stein, Silverstone...
Whatever the fuck her name is.
She, even though she could've walked out the front door, she makes...
Because she's a person of free will and not a prisoner...

JAY:
It's, it's trying to give her some sort of characteristic.
She's gonna steal the...

MIKE:
"Oh, Alfred."
"I'm gonna go to the store."
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You didn't have to make an, uh, uh, uh, an escape rope.

JAY:
From a giant fucking mansion that it's possible no one would've seen you leave anyway.

MIKE:
Hey, is this a backlot?
An-, anyways.
Oh, so this gives her, her, uh, her superhero cred.

JAY:
Yeah.
Now she disappears from the movie for, like, 30 minutes.

MIKE:
Yeah.
She goes and she, she has a death wish, uh, by riding a motorcycle around at night.

JAY:
And now, even though no one has any clue who Poison Ivy is, she has to put on a disguise.
And Bane is also wearing a disguise.

MIKE:
Because, yeah.
His face doesn't give it away.
Oh, but he has a hat on.

JAY:
He has a hat on.
And a trenchcoat.
Rich, is that an accurate representation of the comic book Bane?

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Ear-, earlier on, they, uh, in, in the scene, she goes,
"Bane, get your plane tickets ready."
"We're, you know, we gotta get on a plane."
And I just pictured them going through the airport with them looking like that.

JAY:
Well, he's wearing the hat.

MIKE:
But...
No, no, no.
Later on, they, they have, uh, a surveillance photo.
And they took a charter plane.
Like, a little tiny four-seater plane.

JAY:
Oh, that's right.
And there's a weird bad photoshop.

MIKE:
It's a bad photoshop thing of them walking off the tarmac.
Like, he's got a hat on and a trenchcoat.
And this, just, face.

RICH:
At, at the time, I think the thing that pissed me off the most about this movie was the portrayal of Bane.

MIKE:
Really?

RICH:
Yeah.
Well, everything, everything pissed me off about this movie.
I'm just saying.

JAY:
That, that was it?

RICH:
The thing that pissed me off the most...

JAY:
Did you see this in theaters, Rich?

35m23s
