MIKE:
Hey, everyone.
It's the commentary track you've all been waiting for: Joel Schumacher's hit film Batman and Robin.
Who doesn't want to hear Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans endlessly talk, criticize, and make fun of this historic film, which has recently been added to AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time!

ROBIN:
Chicks dig the car.

MIKE:
This film is currently available on Netflix.

BATMAN:
Hi, Freeze.
I'm Batman.

MIKE:
But unless you have a good internet connection, this screen might mess up your sync.
You can also find the film on those discount 4-packs in your local Wal-Mart garbage bin, or you can just...as I'm sure none of you actually own this movie.
Or do you?
You can also run this commentary track alongside Andy Warhol's film Sleep, as the running time and content is nearly the same!
So grab a beer -- only if you're of legal age -- and watch this film with your imaginary friends, Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans!
While they make fart jokes.
Commentary track now available on Bandcamp.
