hi, everyone, I'm Mike
and I'm Susan
and it's that time of year again
my period
no
but while it is bloody disgusting, I'm talking about Halloween
oh, my god, Mike
that means we have a brand new commentary track available
it's Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street
ooh
wow
but for those of you who just saw the force awakens trailer and don't give two craps about Halloween, we also have a commentary track for Return of the Jedi
oh, my god
two commentary tracks
that's right
and they're available now on our bandcamp page, along with lots of out of stock merchandise
I mean, merchandise
Mike, where are we
why are we in the spooky Cemetery
Oh, silly Susan
this is just the set
it's for our annual Halloween episode of best of the worst, which should be out soon
hopefully before Halloween
hopefully
but Mike, what are people supposed to do with their lives until then
maybe they could go visit dead friends and relatives
maybe volunteer at a homeless shelter
or they can help put down dogs at a kennel
they could do all of those things, Susan
you're right
but more importantly, they should visit our patreon page
what the fuck is that
well, patreon is kind of like a support group for RLM fans
you know, kind of like Alcoholics Anonymous
oh, you mean that group that you got kicked out of for showing up drunk
yeah
but Mike, what do people get for becoming a red letter media patreon
nothing
actually, Mike, if you become a patreon, you get access to text updates, production photos, and exclusive patreon videos, like behind the scenes and outtakes
oh, my fuck, susan
so many exciting things happening at red letter media
mm-hmm
oh, and space cop's done
I'm sorry, what
did you just say space cop is done
yeah, it's done
like done, done
hmm
like, the movie we've been working on for twelve years
like, longer than boyhood
really
like done done
can people buy it now, or what, where is it
well, they can't get it yet
but I mean, the movie's done
oh
so they'll be able to get it soon
oh, so like, it's done done
it's like, done, where we don't have to add anything to it
oh, we're still not working on it
