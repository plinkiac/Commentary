MIKE:
Hi, everyone, I'm Mike.

JAY:
And I'm Susan.

MIKE:
And it's that time of year again.

JAY:
My period?

MIKE:
No.
But while it is bloody disgusting, I'm talking about Halloween!

MIKE:
Oh, my god!
Mike, that means we have a brand new commentary track available.
It's Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street.
Boo-o-o-o!

KREUGER:
Very hot, it's your soul!

MIKE:
Wow.
But for those of you who just saw The Force Awakens trailer and don't give two craps about Halloween, we also have a commentary track for Return of the Jedi!

JAY:
Oh, my god!
Two commentary tracks?

MIKE:
That's right.
And they're available now on our bandcamp page, along with lots of out-of-stock merchandise.
I mean, merchandise.

JAY:
Mike, where are we?
Why are we in the spooky cemetery?

MIKE:
Oh, silly Susan.
This is just the set.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
It's for our annual Halloween episode of Best of the Worst, which should be out soon.
Hopefully before Halloween.

JAY:
Hopefully...but Mike, what are people supposed to do with their lives until then?
Maybe they could go visit dead friends and relatives?
Maybe volunteer at a homeless shelter?
Or they can help put down dogs at a kennel.

MIKE:
They could do all of those things, Susan.
You're right.
But more importantly, they should visit our patreon page.

JAY:
What the fuck is that?

MIKE:
Well, patreon is kind of like a support group for RLM fans.
You know, kind of like Alcoholics Anonymous.

JAY:
Oh, you mean that group that you got kicked out of for showing up drunk?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But Mike, what do people get for becoming a Red Letter Media patron?

MIKE:
Nothing.

JAY:
Actually, Mike, if you become a patron, you get access to, uh, text updates, production photos, and exclusive patreon videos, like behind the scenes and outtakes!

MIKE:
Oh, my fuck, Susan!
So many exciting things happening at Red Letter Media.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
Oh, and Space Cop's done.

MIKE:
I'm sorry, what?
Did you just say Space Cop is done?

JAY:
Yeah, it's done.

MIKE:
Like done, done?

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Like, the movie we've been working on for twelve years?
Like, longer than boyhood?

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Really?
Like, done, done?
Can people buy it now, or what, where is it?

JAY:
Well, they can't get it yet.
But I mean, the movie's done.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
So they'll be able to get it soon.

MIKE:
Oh, so like, it's done, done?

JAY:
It's like, done, where we don't have to add anything to it, or...

MIKE:
Oh, we're still not working on it?

JAY:
We're not...
