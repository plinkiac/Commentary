hi everyone, I'm Mike
and I'm Susan
and we're here to tell you that we have a brand new commentary track available now
that's right, Mike
it's for Masters of the Universe, the live-action he-man flop from Canon films
so dust off your torrent programs and get ready to watch one of the worst films ever made
"I think we've wasted enough time"
and hear us and rich Evans laugh all the way to the bank
I mean, laugh all the way till the end of the film
and be sure to check out some of our other commentary tracks, too
we have plenty of titties available
titles
oh
oh, plenty of other titles
but mike, how does the commentary track work
well, Susan I'm glad you asked
you simply start the film, and then hit play in the commentary track at the point specified by us
in this particular case, it's when the Canon film's logo interlocks
not to be confused with the part in the movie where he man and man-at-arms interlock
gay jokes
they're so 1995
and 1895
but Susan, why are we watching Masters of the Universe
that movie fucked sucked
you know it was based on toys
the toys sucked, too
I mean, Orko
Skeletor
arm man
Stratos
man-e-faces
that was the one where you turn his head, and he had different faces
bee man
asshole mouth man
fuck
but let's not forget about he-man
he's the most embarrassing of them all
I mean, his mentor is an elderly woman
and what kind of man wears purple booties
uh, Mike
yeah
what
look over
is someone I'm talking about standing right behind me
oh, my god
Jesus Christ
he's ripped
oh, please don't hurt me, he-man
Susan, help me
Oh, no
Susan's been kidnapped by embarrassing toys
oh, fuck
