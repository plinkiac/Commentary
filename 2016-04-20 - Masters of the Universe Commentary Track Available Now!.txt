MIKE:
Hi, everyone, I'm Mike.

JAY:
And I'm Susan.

MIKE:
And we're here to tell you that we have a brand new commentary track available now.

JAY:
That's right, Mike. It's for Masters of the Universe, the live-action He-Man flop from Cannon films.

MIKE:
So dust off your torrent programs and get ready to watch one of the worst films ever made!

TEELA:
I think we've wasted enough time.

JAY:
And hear us, and Rich Evans, laugh all the way to the bank! I mean, laugh all the way till the end of the film.

MIKE:
And be sure to check out some of our other commentary tracks, too! We have plenty of titties available. Titles. Oh, oh! Plenty of other titles.

JAY:
But Mike, how does the commentary track work?

MIKE:
Well, Susan, I'm glad you asked. You simply start the film, and then hit play in the commentary track at the point specified by us. In this particular case, it's when the Cannon film's logo interlocks.

JAY:
Not to be confused with the part in the movie where He-Man and Man-at-Arms interlock. Gay jokes! They're so 1995.

MIKE:
And 1895. But Susan, why are we watching Masters of the Universe? That movie fucked sucked. You know it was based on toys?

JAY:
Yeah...

MIKE:
The toys sucked, too. I mean, Orko? Skeletor? Ram Man? Stratos? Man-E-Faces?  That was the one where you turn his head, and he had different faces. Bee Man? Asshole Mouth Man? Fuck...but let's not forget about He-Man. He's the most embarrassing of them all. I mean, his mentor is an elderly woman. And what kind of man wears purple booties?

JAY:
Uh, Mike.

MIKE:
Yeah? What?

JAY:
Look over...

MIKE:
Is someone I'm talking about standing right behind me? Oh, my god! Jesus Christ, he's ripped. Oh, please don't hurt me, He-Man! Susan, help me! Oh, no! Susan's been kidnapped by embarrassing toys! Oh, fuck!
