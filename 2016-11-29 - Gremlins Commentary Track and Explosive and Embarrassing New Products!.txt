JAY:
Hi, it's me, Jay.

MIKE:
Oh, hi, Susan.

JAY:
And it's that weird time of year in between Halloween and Christmas.

MIKE:
That's right, Susan. That magical time of year where not much really happens...except for the Green Bay Packers lose a lot of football games.

JAY:
But Mike, if I want to watch a movie what do I watch? Something scary, or something Christmas-y?

MIKE:
How about something that's a little bit of both? I know what movie we're talking about!

BOTH:
Gremlins!

JAY:
Yeah. We now have a commentary track available for one of our favorite movies of all time.

MIKE:
Well, Susan, let's talk about some new merch!

JAY:
That's right, Mike. In addition to Space Cop Blu-rays being restocked, we've also got some classic shirts back, too.

MIKE:
As well as some new shirt designs, too, like this RLM DeLorean company-style logo.

JAY:
And my personal favorite, the best of the worst VHS pile logo. Remember VHS tapes, you fucking hipsters?

MIKE:
Impress your friends.

JAY:
And for you alcoholics out there, we've got more bottle openers. Open your beer with them! Or throw them at your significant other in a drunken rage!

MIKE:
But our most exciting new products are two new high-quality posters, like this one. It's the RLM gang, Disney-fied, drawn by an actual artist who works for Disney. His name has been withheld upon request.

JAY:
Did he intentionally make us all look like monsters?

MIKE:
Actually, no. This is a photograph.

JAY:
And this beautiful RLM typography art poster, featuring all of your most favoritest RLM sayings, like:

MIKE:
"What's wrong with your face?"

JAY:
"Oh, my god."

MIKE:
"I want that juicy Shaq meat."

JAY:
"Don't you want to put it back in my taco?"

MIKE:
"My cat ain't gonna milk itself."

JAY:
"A stepladder."

MIKE:
"My cat stole all of my merkins."

JAY:
"It took 12 years to make."

MIKE:
"Is this replacing...the last poster?" And much, much more.

JAY:
And also, these posters are printed on a high-quality cardstock.

MIKE:
That's great, Susan! People could hang them up on their walls! I guess you could say that these two new posters are the best things from Wisconsin to be framed since Steven Avery!

JAY:
Order now! Greg, our sales agent, is standing by!

MIKE:
You might want to say that one again.

JAY:
Oh, did I say something wrong?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
It was a little, a little uncomfortable the way, the way that you phrased it.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Maybe try it again one more time.

JAY:
Okay. I'll do another. Order now! Greg, our crippled sales agent, is standing by!

MIKE:
That's much better.
