hi, it's me, Jay
oh, hi, Susan
and it's that weird time of year in between Halloween and Christmas
that's right, Susan
that magical time of year where not much really happens
except for the Green Bay Packers lose a lot of football games
but Mike, if I want to watch a movie what do i watch something scary, or something Christmassy
how about something that's a little bit of both
I know what movie we're talking about
gremlins
yeah
we now have a commentary track available for one of our favorite movies of all time
well, Susan, let's talk about some new merch
that's right, Mike
in addition to space cop blu-rays being restocked, we've also got some classic shirts back, too
as well as some new shirt designs too, like this rlm DeLorean company style logo
and my personal favorite, the best of the worst VHS pile logo
remember VHS tapes you fucking hipsters
impress your friends
and for you alcoholics out there, we've got more bottle openers
open your beer with them
or throw them at your significant other in a drunken rage
but our most exciting new products are two new high-quality posters, like this one
it's the rlm gang disney-fied, drawn by an actual artist who works for disney
his name has been withheld upon request
did he intentionally make us all look like monsters
actually, no
this is a photograph
and this beautiful rlm typography art poster featuring all of your most favoritest rlm saints, like:
what's wrong with your face
oh, my god
I want that juicy Shaq meat
don't you want to put it back in my taco
my cat ain't gonna milk itself
a stepladder
my cat stole all of my merkins
it took 12 years to make
is this replacing the last poster
and much, much more
and also, these posters are printed on a high-quality cardstock
that's great, Susan
people could hang them up on their walls
I guess you could say that these two new posters are the best things from Wisconsin to be framed since Steven Avery
order now
greg, our sales agent, is standing by
you might want to say that one again
oh, did I say something wrong
yeah
okay
it was a little, a little uncomfortable the way, the way that you phrased it
okay
maybe try it again one more time
okay
I'll do another
order now
Greg, our crippled sales agent, is standing by
that's much better
