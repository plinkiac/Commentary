t-shirts are back in stock
who are you
that's right, Susan
our t-shirts are finally back in stock: lightning fast VCR repair, best of the worst, shameful corporate logo, and our always popular nerd crew shirt
very cool
Oh, nerd crew
that's that show where we make fun of shameless corporate products
like slapping your logo on a t-shirt
or a bottle opener
or a poster
coincidentally, we have those available, too
as seen in these corporate images
which reminds me
uh
even our half and the bag shirts are back in stock
uh
and to all you little pricks asking
no, we don't have small
or xxxxl, you fatsos
so stop asking
isn't it wonderful how much we disrespect our audience
not to mention ourselves
hey, speaking of disrespecting your audience, we have a commentary track for the Justice League
available now
oh, is that that exciting new PBS documentary about the Supreme Court
no, i wish
that would be so fucking exciting and action-packed
sadly, it's just a DC film
oh
Batman wishes he was as cool as Ruth Bader Ginsburg
so check out all the new shit today
links will be in the description box below
and don't forget, we have a patreon, too
I don't know what that is, but we have one
I sure hope it's not some kind of venereal disease
oh, no, Mike
patreon is an exclusive-tiered subscription thingy
where you get updates on upcoming videos, behind-the-scenes photos, and even exclusive videos and outtakes
people pay for that
Wow, patreon sounds exciting
I'm so ashamed
thanks, Trump
look at his pants
