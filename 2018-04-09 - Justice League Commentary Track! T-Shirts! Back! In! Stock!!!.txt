MIKE:
T-shirts are back in stock!

JAY:
Who are you?

MIKE:
That's right, Susan. Our t-shirts are finally back in stock: Lightning Fast VCR Repair, Best of the Worst, shameful corporate logo, and our always popular Nerd Crew shirt. Very cool!

JAY:
Oh, Nerd Crew! That's that show where we make fun of shameless corporate products. Like slapping your logo on a t-shirt.

MIKE:
Or a bottle opener.

JAY:
Or a poster. Coincidentally, we have those available, too.

MIKE:
As seen in these corporate images.

JAY:
Which reminds me.

MIKE:
Uh?

JAY:
Even our Half in the Bag shirts are back in stock.

MIKE:
Uh?

JAY:
And to all you little pricks asking, no, we don't have small.

MIKE:
Or XXXXL, you fatsos. So stop asking!

JAY:
Isn't it wonderful how much we disrespect our audience?

MIKE:
Not to mention ourselves! Hey, speaking of disrespecting your audience, we have a commentary track for the Justice League. Available now!

JAY:
Oh, is that that exciting new PBS documentary about the Supreme Court?

MIKE:
No, I wish. That would be so fucking exciting and action-packed. Sadly, it's just a DC film.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Batman wishes he was as cool as Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

JAY:
So check out all the new shit today. Links will be in the description box below.

MIKE:
And don't forget, we have a patreon, too. I don't know what that is, but we have one. I sure hope it's not some kind of venereal disease.

JAY:
Oh, no, Mike. Patreon is an exclusive-tiered subscription thingy. Where you get updates on upcoming videos, behind-the-scenes photos, and even exclusive videos and outtakes.

MIKE:
People pay for that? Wow, Patreon sounds exciting. I'm so ashamed. Thanks, Trump! Look at his pants!
