MIKE:
Hello, and welcome to our commentary track for Army of Darkness.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
I'm Jay.

RICH:
I am Rich Evans.

JAY:
And that's Bruce Campbell's feet.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
And that's Bruce Campbell.

JAY:
And his, his stump that is stuck in that thing even though it makes no sense.

RICH:
So we're watching Army of Darkness.
And this is one of the worst movies ever made.
Let's all make fun of this movie.

MIKE:
When he says,
"My, my name is Ash, and I am a slave."
Is that a reference to something?
Is that, like, the opening line of something famous?

JAY:
Not that I know of.

MIKE:
I always thought it was, and I've never looked it up, because it's such an odd line.

JAY:
It is.
It is.

MIKE:
It sounds like it's, uh...
I don't know.

JAY:
Well, you'll notice here, the housewares department, like, the sign placement and everything looks different than it does at the end of the film because this was a part of the original filming, and the ending was a re-shoot.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
The re-done ending.
