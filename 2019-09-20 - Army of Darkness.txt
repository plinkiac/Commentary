MIKE:
Hello, and welcome to our commentary track for Army of Darkness.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
I'm Jay.

RICH:
I am Rich Evans.

JAY:
And that's Bruce Campbell's feet.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
And that's Bruce Campbell.

JAY:
And his, his stump that is stuck in that thing even though it makes no sense.

RICH:
So we're watching Army of Darkness.
And this is one of the worst movies ever made.
Let's all make fun of this movie.

MIKE:
When he says,
"My, my name is Ash, and I am a slave."
Is that a reference to something?
Is that, like, the opening line of something famous?

JAY:
Not that I know of.

MIKE:
I always thought it was, and I've never looked it up, because it's such an odd line.

JAY:
It is.
It is.

MIKE:
It sounds like it's, uh...
I don't know.

JAY:
Well, you'll notice here, the housewares department, like, the sign placement and everything looks different than it does at the end of the film because this was a part of the original filming, and the ending was a re-shoot.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
The re-done ending.

And that was Bridget Fonda, for some reason.

RICH:
She wanted to be in Evil Dead.

JAY:
I think she just, yeah.
She's a fan.
It makes sense.
She ends up in, uh, A Simple Plan.
Sam Raimi put her in another movie.
Um, but I was gonna say, it would make sense if it was, like, Holly Hunter or something because there was a period of time when, like, Sam Raimi and the Coen Brothers and, like, Holly Hunter all lived in a house together.
Like, when they were all starting out in Hollywood.
But this is footage from Evil Dead II.
This opening re-cap of the, the first two Evil Dead movies is a combination of footage from Evil Dead II and, uh, re-shot stuff.
Like, when he cuts his hand off, it's a re-shoot, because they didn't want to be as bloody.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's one thing I, I, I noticed watching this movie is that it has an R-rating.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
It really shouldn't.

JAY:
It shouldn't.
They tr-, they made it with the intention of it being PG-13, but for whatever reason the ratings board just kept coming back with an R.

MIKE:
Oh, really?

JAY:
And that...

MIKE:I could think of one particular scene that made it, makes it R.
But, uh...
He's, because he says "fuck" once.

JAY:
You can say "fuck" once in a PG-13, yeah.

MIKE:
He's said,
"Get the fuck out of my way."
When he, when he's coming back with the book.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, I would, I would, I would venture to guess it's the, the fountain of human blood that gives it the R-rating.

JAY:
The, the fountain of Kool-Aid, you mean?

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then they said,
"Yeah, you can't show that."

RICH:
You know, my, my, my mother used to love horror movies.
And she'd have us watch horror movies all the time.
And I, I vaguely remember watching this with her as a kid.And she didn't know it was a sequel to Evil Dead II.
And we got to this, and she's like,
"Oh, it's the guy from that movie."

JAY:
Well, that's, that's the most baffling thing, is that this movie, it wasn't produced by Universal Pictures.
It was, like, picked up for U.S. distribution by Universal.
But the idea that they thought they could market it as just, like, a standalone movie is so baffling.

MIKE:
Was there, like, just talks of calling it Evil Dead III?

JAY:
Uh, well, I think Sam Raimi wanted to call it The Medieval Dead.
Which is very clever.

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
But, no.
It's just Army of Darkness.
I, I think they kind of wanted it to sort of work as a standalone movie, but, I mean, all this opening is just, like, if it was just, just its own movie...

MIKE:
I always hate that...

JAY:
It's just all so baffling.

MIKE:
Sorry.
I always hate that you kid see those boards.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
It drives me nuts.

JAY:
That was a shot from Evil Dead II.
And then we cut to this shot, which was shot for Army of Darkness.
And, like, the color temperature's completely different.

MIKE:
Oh, right.

JAY:
The location isn't the same at all.

MIKE:
What, what shot was that from, Evil Dead II?

JAY:
That's the end of Evil Dead II.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, that's right.
The original ending.
And then they, they...
What happens?
They, uh...

JAY:
A horrible flying hag monster flies in and Ash shoots its head off.

MIKE:
And he shoots it.
It's like a truncated version of this opening.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:That's right.

JAY:
Well, the truncated version of the whole movie.
Because then they're like,
"Heil he who has come from the sky."

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And then he goes...

JAY:
And then kind of happens later in this.

MIKE:
He starts going,
"No!"
"No!"
"No!"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.

JAY:
It's a great ending.

MIKE:
That's right.
That's right.
It's been a while since I've seen Evil Dead II.

JAY:
This is one of the most bizarre series of movies ever made, as far as none of them being similar in any way tonally.

RICH:
Do people generally like this more than Evil Dead II?

JAY:
Um, I think Evil Dead II is the most well-liked.

RICH:
Yeah?

JAY:
Well, it's the best.

RICH:
It is.

JAY:
But we're, we're talking about Army of Darkness.
But Evil Dead II is the best, I, in my opinion.
But that's the thing is, like, you have Evil Dead, which is super cheap and rough around the edges, but it's basically a straight horror movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Evil Dead II, which is like a weirdo horror comedy.
And then this, which is more of, like, an adventure slapstick comedy.
There's not a whole lot of horror in this film.

MIKE:
This is the Gremlins 2 of the Gremlins series.

JAY:
Yes.
Yes.

MIKE:
It gets very Looney Tunes.

RICH:
So does Evil Dead II, honestly.

MIKE:
It does, yeah.

JAY:
But still, as a horror film...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
The, this, I mean, this is just pure goofiness.

RICH:
Well, the whole pretext has been dropped.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
There's no, uh, Three Stooges bit in Evil Dead II, as far as I remember.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Technically, there is.

MIKE:
There is?
Oh.
What?
What is that, Jay?

JAY:
When, when the, when the, uh, creature in the basement, when they, they stomp on its head, and its eyeball pops out.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
And it lands in the l-, the little girl's mouth.
That's directly from a Three Stooges movie.
But it works as a horror sequence as well.
A very silly one.
But, yeah.
But this one is, like, goofy comical skeletons poking him in the eyes.
It's nonsense.

MIKE:
Wow.
Europe really looks like Southern California.
I guess they could be in, like, like, Spain or something.

RICH:
Well, that's not very likely.

MIKE:
Now I never noticed this until I, I watched this is Blu-ray, but, uh, Henry the Red and all of his men are, are gingers.

JAY:
I don't think I ever noticed that either.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
They're all redheads.

JAY:
That's pretty funny.

MIKE:
God bless high-definition.

JAY:
You can still find new things in, in stupid old movies.

MIKE:
It's a joke against redheaded people.
I guess.

JAY:
We have Arthur and, uh, Sheila, who are, like, the only people that treat this movie seriously.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The rest of the movie is just a gigantic joke.
Children just beating him up.

MIKE:
I don't know why I saw this stuff as just so funny.
I think it's just performance.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
This, this is, this is...

MIKE:
"Ow!"
"Cut it out!"

JAY:
As far as a comedic performance goes, this is my favorite Bruce Campbell performance.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
As far as a physical performance, probably Evil Dead II when he's doing all the, when his hand's possessed, and he's, you know, flipping himself over in the kitchen and everything.
But as far just a straight...
I mean, this is what kind of cemented the Bruce Campbell persona...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The sort of cocky, but also incredibly dumb.
Which is also another interesting thing about this series in that each iteration, Ash just gets dumber.
First, first movie, he's, like, college guy.
Second movie, he's a little silly.And then this is, like, nonsense.
And then, Ash vs Evil Dead, he's even dumber.

MIKE:
I don't know if I'd call him dumb, so much as selfish and...

JAY:
Overly cocky.

MIKE:
Monstrous.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Was Big Trouble in Little China an influence?

JAY:
Um, I don't know.I've never heard it being an influence as far as anything I've read from Sam Raimi.

RICH:
It's similar where you take, like, an action hero protagonist, but he's also kind of an incompetent boob.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's true.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's very reminiscient of that, sure.

JAY:
I don't, yeah.
I don't know if it was an intentional influence or not.
This feels more...
That's the weird thing about this movie.
It's like this big adventure, you know, time travel swashbuckling thing.And then Sam Raimi's just like,
"The lead will be Bruce Campbell."

RICH:
Well that's, that's your gimmick..

JAY:
The whole, the whole movie's a joke.
Which is again why it's weird that, like, you kind of have to be in on the joke to get the movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, did either of you see this in the theater?

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
You did?
Oh, okay.
I thought I might be the only one.

MIKE:
No.
A friend of mine was into Evil Dead...

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
And Evil Dead II.
And then, yeah.
I think I saw this at the dollar show.

JAY:
I mentioned it because my dad took me to see it, because it was rated-R, so I couldn't get in.
And I was really excited to check it out.
And at the end of the movie, he just goes,
"I don't know what the hell was happening in that entire movie."

MIKE:
It's pretty clear, though.

JAY:
I think it, maybe it was the tone threw him off.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because it's like,
"What is this?"
It's, like, nonsense.

RICH:
It's basically an in-joke.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
And that's what crazy is, like, Universal tried to sell...
Because I, how I found out about this movie was, uh, through the trailer that said, like, "From Sam Raimi, director of Dark Man."
And I liked Dark Man.
Uh, but I didn't know what this was.
And then I read in Fangoria that it was a sequel to these Evil Dead movies.

RICH:
Did Dark Man come out before this?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Holy shit.

JAY:
Cou-, couple years before it.
Which also makes this movie funnier, because it's like,
"Oh, Sam Raimi has a modest hit with Dark Man.""He's gonna follow it up with this Evil Dead sequel."

RICH:
Dark Man is underrated.

JAY:
I like Dark Man a lot.
Sam, Sam Raimi's first attempt at a slightly off-kilter comic book movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then he shoots scenes like this with the arrow.
