MIKE:
Hello, and welcome to our commentary track for Army of Darkness.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
I'm Jay.

RICH:
I am Rich Evans.

JAY:
And that's Bruce Campbell's feet.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
And that's Bruce Campbell.

JAY:
And his, his stump that is stuck in that thing even though it makes no sense.

RICH:
So we're watching Army of Darkness.
And this is one of the worst movies ever made.
Let's all make fun of this movie.

MIKE:
When he says,
"My, my name is Ash, and I am a slave."
Is that a reference to something?
Is that, like, the opening line of something famous?

JAY:
Not that I know of.

MIKE:
I always thought it was, and I've never looked it up, because it's such an odd line.

JAY:
It is.
It is.

MIKE:
It sounds like it's, uh...
I don't know.

JAY:
Well, you'll notice here, the housewares department, like, the sign placement and everything looks different than it does at the end of the film because this was a part of the original filming, and the ending was a re-shoot.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
The re-done ending.
And that was Bridget Fonda, for some reason.

RICH:
She wanted to be in Evil Dead.

JAY:
I think she just, yeah.
She's a fan.
It makes sense.
She ends up in, uh, A Simple Plan later.
Sam Raimi put her in another movie.
Um, but I was gonna say, it would make sense if it was, like, Holly Hunter or something because there was a period of time when, like, Sam Raimi and the Coen Brothers and, like, Holly Hunter all lived in a house together.
Like, when they were all starting out in Hollywood.
But this is footage from Evil Dead II.
This opening re-cap of the, the first two Evil Dead movies is a combination of footage from Evil Dead II and, uh, re-shot stuff.
Like, when he cuts his hand off, it's a re-shoot, because they didn't want to be as bloody.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's one thing I, I, I noticed watching this movie is that it has an R-rating.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
It really shouldn't.

JAY:
It shouldn't.
They tr-, they made it with the intention of it being PG-13, but for whatever reason the ratings board just kept coming back with an R.

MIKE:
Oh, really?

JAY:
And that...

MIKE:
I could think of one particular scene that made it, makes it R.
But, uh...
He's, because he says "fuck" once.

JAY:
You can say "fuck" once in a PG-13, yeah.

MIKE:
He's said,
"Get the fuck out of my way."
When he, when he's coming back with the book.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, I would, I would, I would venture to guess it's the, the fountain of human blood that gives it the R-rating.

JAY:
The, the fountain of Kool-Aid, you mean?

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then they said,
"Yeah, you can't show that."

RICH:
You know, my, my, my mother used to love horror movies.
And she'd have us watch horror movies all the time.
And I, I vaguely remember watching this with her as a kid.
And she didn't know it was a sequel to Evil Dead II.
And we got to this, and she's like,
"Oh, it's the guy from that movie."

JAY:
Well, that's, that's the most baffling thing, is that this movie, it wasn't produced by Universal Pictures.
It was, like, picked up for U.S. distribution by Universal.
But the idea that they thought they could market it as just, like, a standalone movie is so baffling.

MIKE:
Was there, like, just talks of calling it Evil Dead III?

JAY:
Uh, well, I think Sam Raimi wanted to call it The Medieval Dead.
Which is very clever.

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
But, no.
It's just Army of Darkness.
I, I think they kind of wanted it to sort of work as a standalone movie, but, I mean, all this opening is just, like, if it was just, just its own movie...

MIKE:
I always hate that...

JAY:
It's just all so baffling.

MIKE:
Sorry.
I always hate that you kid see those boards.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
It drives me nuts.

JAY:
That was a shot from Evil Dead II.
And then we cut to this shot, which was shot for Army of Darkness.
And, like, the color temperature's completely different.

MIKE:
Oh, right.

JAY:
The location isn't the same at all.

MIKE:
What, what shot was that from, Evil Dead II?

JAY:
That's the end of Evil Dead II.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, that's right.
The original ending.
And then they, they...
What happens?
They, uh...

JAY:
A horrible flying hag monster flies in and Ash shoots its head off.

MIKE:
And he shoots it.
It's like a truncated version of this opening.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's right.

JAY:
Well, the truncated version of the whole movie.
Because then they're like,
"Heil he who has come from the sky."

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And then he goes...

JAY:
And then kind of happens later in this.

MIKE:
He starts going,
"No!"
"No!"
"No!"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.

JAY:
It's a great ending.

MIKE:
That's right.
That's right.
It's been a while since I've seen Evil Dead II.

JAY:
This is one of the most bizarre series of movies ever made, as far as none of them being similar in any way tonally.

RICH:
Do people generally like this more than Evil Dead II?

JAY:
Um, I think Evil Dead II is the most well-liked.

RICH:
Yeah?

JAY:
Well, it's the best.

RICH:
It is.

JAY:
But we're, we're talking about Army of Darkness.
But Evil Dead II is the best, I, in my opinion.
But that's the thing is, like, you have Evil Dead, which is super cheap and rough around the edges, but it's basically a straight horror movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Evil Dead II, which is like a weirdo horror comedy.
And then this, which is more of, like, an adventure slapstick comedy.
There's not a whole lot of horror in this film.

MIKE:
This is the Gremlins 2 of the Gremlins series.

JAY:
Yes.
Yes.

MIKE:
It gets very Looney Tunes.

RICH:
So does Evil Dead II, honestly.

MIKE:
It does, yeah.

JAY:
But still, as a horror film...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
The, this, I mean, this is just pure goofiness.

RICH:
Well, the whole pretext has been dropped.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
There's no, uh, Three Stooges bit in Evil Dead II, as far as I remember.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Technically, there is.

MIKE:
There is?
Oh.
What?
What is that, Jay?

JAY:
When, when the, when the, uh, creature in the basement, when they, they stomp on its head, and its eyeball pops out.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
And it lands in the l-, the little girl's mouth.
That's directly from a Three Stooges movie.
But it works as a horror sequence as well.
A very silly one.
But, yeah.
But this one is, like, goofy comical skeletons poking him in the eyes.
It's nonsense.

MIKE:
Wow.
Europe really looks like Southern California.
I guess they could be in, like, like, Spain or something.

RICH:
Well, that's not very likely.

MIKE:
Now I never noticed this until I, I watched this is Blu-ray, but, uh, Henry the Red and all of his men are, are gingers.

JAY:
I don't think I ever noticed that either.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
They're all redheads.

JAY:
That's pretty funny.

MIKE:
God bless high-definition.

JAY:
You can still find new things in, in stupid old movies.

MIKE:
It's a joke against redheaded people.
I guess.

JAY:
We have Arthur and, uh, Sheila, who are, like, the only people that treat this movie seriously.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The rest of the movie is just a gigantic joke.
Children just beating him up.

MIKE:
I don't know why I saw this stuff as just so funny.
I think it's just performance.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
This, this is, this is...

MIKE:
"Ow!"
"Cut it out!"

JAY:
As far as a comedic performance goes, this is my favorite Bruce Campbell performance.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
As far as a physical performance, probably Evil Dead II when he's doing all the, when his hand's possessed, and he's, you know, flipping himself over in the kitchen and everything.
But as far just a straight...
I mean, this is what kind of cemented the Bruce Campbell persona...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The sort of cocky, but also incredibly dumb.
Which is also another interesting thing about this series in that each iteration, Ash just gets dumber.
First, first movie, he's, like, college guy.
Second movie, he's a little silly.
And then this is, like, nonsense.
And then, Ash vs Evil Dead, he's even dumber.

MIKE:
I don't know if I'd call him dumb, so much as selfish and...

JAY:
Overly cocky.

MIKE:
Monstrous.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Was Big Trouble in Little China an influence?

JAY:
Um, I don't know.
I've never heard it being an influence as far as anything I've read from Sam Raimi.

RICH:
It's similar where you take, like, an action hero protagonist, but he's also kind of an incompetent boob.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's true.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's very reminiscient of that, sure.

JAY:
I don't, yeah.
I don't know if it was an intentional influence or not.
This feels more...
That's the weird thing about this movie.
It's like this big adventure, you know, time travel swashbuckling thing.
And then Sam Raimi's just like,
"The lead will be Bruce Campbell."

RICH:
Well that's, that's your gimmick..

JAY:
The whole, the whole movie's a joke.
Which is again why it's weird that, like, you kind of have to be in on the joke to get the movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, did either of you see this in the theater?

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
You did?
Oh, okay.
I thought I might be the only one.

MIKE:
No.
A friend of mine was into Evil Dead...

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
And Evil Dead II.
And then, yeah.
I think I saw this at the dollar show.

JAY:
I mentioned it because my dad took me to see it, because it was rated-R, so I couldn't get in.
And I was really excited to check it out.
And at the end of the movie, he just goes,
"I don't know what the hell was happening in that entire movie."

MIKE:
It's pretty clear, though.

JAY:
I think it, maybe it was the tone threw him off.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because it's like,
"What is this?"
It's, like, nonsense.

RICH:
It's basically an in-joke.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
And that's what crazy is, like, Universal tried to sell...
Because I, how I found out about this movie was, uh, through the trailer that said, like, "From Sam Raimi, director of Dark Man."
And I liked Dark Man.
Uh, but I didn't know what this was.
And then I read in Fangoria that it was a sequel to these Evil Dead movies.

RICH:
Did Dark Man come out before this?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Holy shit.

JAY:
Cou-, couple years before it.
Which also makes this movie funnier, because it's like,
"Oh, Sam Raimi has a modest hit with Dark Man."
"He's gonna follow it up with this Evil Dead sequel."

RICH:
Dark Man is underrated.

JAY:
I like Dark Man a lot.
Sam, Sam Raimi's first attempt at a slightly off-kilter comic book movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then he shoots scenes like this with the arrow.

JAY:
The camera's following the arrow.
Well, this is, yeah.

MIKE:
He sped up, like, like, cartoon, like, uh...

JAY:
It's classic Sam Raimi stuff.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's full...

MIKE:
I love shots like this where there, there's a lot of scenes like this where the camera moves, and all these characters either come into frame.
Um, this just super long...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Camera move.
There's one where, after he defeats everybody, or the bad guys, the camera's moving back, and all these main characters are kind of stepping into frame, one after the other.

JAY:
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
There's, there's really cinematic shots, and then there's slapstick nonsense.

JAY:
Lock down the camera and throw rubber skeletons at Bruce Campbell.

MIKE:
Right.
Right.
Right.
For ten minutes of, uh, slapstick with skeleton hands hitting him in the eyes.
And, uh, Looney Tunes sound effects.

JAY:
A very famous sound effect later on in the movie that we'll have to point out when it gets there.

MIKE:
What, Wilhelm scream?

JAY:
No.
No.

MIKE:
Oh.
Kurlan naiskos?

JAY:
Yeah.
The classic pottery-breaking sound effect makes an appearance.

RICH:
So, why didn't Bruce Campbell become a bigger star?
Obviously, he's big in the right circles.

JAY:
Yeah.
He's big in b-movie circles.

RICH:
But he was never a big star.
And why isn't, why isn't that the case?
He's funny as fuck.

JAY:
I don't know.
It just never really happened.

MIKE:
Is he a good actor-actor?

RICH:
Well, you don't put him in, in, like, serious dramatic roles.
You find a goofy comedy, and you put him in that.

MIKE:
Like a, like a buddy cop movie kind of thing?

RICH:
Sure.

MIKE:
I guess so.

JAY:
He's got the leading man looks.
Like, he looks like an action star.
Oh, look.
You can see the woman's head on the side of the frame.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
You can see her hair a little bit there.
This is a great little set, too.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
You can see her laying down.
Look at that.
This movie's a mess.

RICH:
It's terrible.
I told you when this started, this is the worst movie.

JAY:
It's true.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
There's so many mistakes...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And bad things in this movie.

JAY:
Well, that's, that's part of...
I mean, it's kind of like Martin Scorcese with his editing, where it's like...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's not concerned about continuity.
He's just concerned about the flow of the scene.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
And Sam Raimi is, is just definitely doesn't care about continuity or little minor errors.
It's all about just what, what works for the gag.

MIKE:
Right.
So I don't know if this is some kind of...
Is this some kind of Indiana Jones homage?
He does the belt whip thing.

JAY:
Well, I was gonna ask about that when it happens.

MIKE:
It's pointless.

JAY:
It's pointless.

MIKE:
Because he could just...

JAY:
Like, why doesn't he just grab the chain?

MIKE:
He could grab onto the chain.
So it seems, like, almost, like...
Oh, this, this is the best moment in the whole movie.

RICH:
It, it makes it slightly more exciting and action-y.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I know.
He, he, because he, yeah.
It adds tension.
The belt could break.

JAY:
Yeah.
I suppose.

MIKE:
But it doesn't, it doesn't make sense.

JAY:
Not at all.
But it works in the moment, which is Sam Raimi's whole thing.

MIKE:
Whoop!

JAY:
See, now, like, this, if you watch this as a standalone movie, that opening recap that tries to set everything up does not explain the chainsaw arm at all.

MIKE:
Well, the, the, the wizard finds it and holds it up.

JAY:
But the, but why it...

RICH:
Why it exists.

JAY:
Is fitted for his stump.
None of it makes any sense.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Look at that great shot through the middle of the spikes.

MIKE:
He explains that he has to cut off his hand.
That's explained in the recap.

JAY:
Yeah.
They explain that.
But they don't explain why he has a chainsaw that fits right on there.
This is a great monster.
It's a shame that it doesn't have any articulation.

MIKE:
That's true.

JAY:
It's essentially a Halloween costume.

MIKE:
He was a Halloween storehand.
It sticks to get that guy's face.

JAY:
Do you, do you know who's in this monster costume?

MIKE:
I do not.
Sam Raimi?

JAY:
No.

RICH:
Sam Raimi?

JAY:
I don't know the actor's name, but it's the same guy that played the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

RICH:
Oh.

JAY:
In Ghostbusters, yeah.

MIKE:
Wow.

JAY:
Yeah.
Like, here, he's holding the chain.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But then in the close-up, he's not.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
It's all just a bunch of nonsense.

MIKE:
That's why with the spikes coming in and the, like...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I don't know.
Have you listened to the reel commentary for this, Jay?

JAY:
I have.
It's been a long time.
But they don't explain that.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Because that was one of my main questions.

MIKE:
Or how this guy...

JAY:
When it comes to questions of logic, they usually don't bother explaining those in the Sam Raimi commentaries.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He doesn't care.

MIKE:
"Listen up, you primitive screw-heads."
He has so many great lines in this.
And that was, like, my, my youth, just repeating every line from this movie.

JAY:
Yeah.
This was...
I, I may have seen this movie more than any other movie ever.
Because there was a period when it first came out on home video, I watched it, like, every day after school for, like, six months.
This is one of those ones where I knew, like, every sound effect, even.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
One of those.

MIKE:
Yep.
"You wanna little?"
"You want some?"

JAY:
Had either of you seen the other Evil Dead movies before this?

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
You did?

RICH:
I did not.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Again, I had a friend who was really into this...

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
And they would always say,
"Dead by dawn!"
"Dead by dawn!"

JAY:
Yeah.
I, I had...
Like, I d-, I just saw the trailer for this before something, and I knew it was the guy who did Dark Man.
And that was all I knew.
But then before it came out, I was reading in Fangoria -- they had an article about it -- and they mentioned that it was a sequel to the Evil Dead movies.
So I was like,
"Oh, before I see this, I gotta watch those other ones, I guess."

RICH:
I just remember there was a moderate amount of hype around it.

JAY:
There was?
For this?

RICH:
Well, it depends on who you knew.

JAY:
Yeah.
I guess, yeah.
Depends on certain people.
But I know this was, like, a giant bomb when it came out because nobody knew what the hell it was.
But I had a, yeah, a weekend, like, before we went and saw this where we rented the, the first two movies and watched 'em back-to-back, and it was a magical time.
The, the Evil Dead trilogy kind of changed my life.
This was, like, the series that made me kind of made me understand what a filmmaker was.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
Because the style is so broad...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That it's, like, that was where I was like,
"Oh, somebody made these decisions."
"Like, these shots and all the, the, the creativity and the weirdness."
I was like,
"Somebody made this."

MIKE:
"The sword boy's job."

JAY:
Then he just kicks him down.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
Like, the pacing of this moment where he shoots the top of his sword off, and then it cuts to all these different reaction shots, and just, like, the shot of the, uh, flag.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, the, the pacing of it is all so perfect.
This is sort of a POV shot.
Kind of.

MIKE:
It's like it's a gun POV.
All the little, all the little...
The people look so small and, like, they look like, like, I don't know.
Tribal people...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Looking at something.

JAY:
Yeah.
They're looking at it like it's a, like, a deity or something.

MIKE:
Right.
Yes.
He's establishing his power.
Standing on something raises him above everybody else.

JAY:
Despite the fact that he's a complete buffoon.
That's the, that's the fun of this in that it, it becomes even more prominent in Ash vs Evil Dead, is that he's a complete buffoon about everything killing monsters.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
He's a badass when it comes to killing demons.

MIKE:
He's just a guy that wants to get home, Jay.

JAY:
He's just a complete selfish asshole.
Which, again, they build up even more in Ash vs Evil Dead.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This scene particularly demonstrates that.
Look how he's sitting on that.

JAY:
It's funny, too, like, I think...
Because this was, like, a re-shoot.
Like, they didn't do this when they initially shot the movie.
So if you look at Arthur's beard here...

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
It's, like, like, glued on.
It's like a cheap fake beard.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And this set's so tiny.
I don't know if they shot it or they ran out of money or what, but there was the comic book adaptation that was what this scene was originally supposed to be.
It was, like, this big room with all these pillars.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And the witch lady that comes up was knocking the pillars, and they were going down like dominoes.
Like, it was this big, elaborate thing.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
And here, we just get, like, a two-wall set.

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
It's like a, like a high school play.
Did they not shoot that scene?
They just ran out of money?

JAY:
I, I don't know.
It was kind of unclear.
I think they, like, just ran out of money or something and they didn't shoot it.
But that was the original idea for this scene.
And then they ended up filming it later.
There's a couple scenes they shot later, you can see when they're by, like, Vasquez Rocks, that Ash's hair is longer than it is in the rest of the movie.

MIKE:
Mm.
And...snap zoom.

JAY:
Yeah!
A classic hag.
Evil Dead hag monster.

MIKE:
"You shall die!"

JAY:
And this witch lady is, uh, Patricia Tallman, who is, like, an actress and stuntperson.
She started with, like, George Romero's camp.
She's in, like, George Romero's Knightrider, and she played Barbara in the Night of the Living Dead remake.

MIKE:
Oh.

RICH:
Oh.

JAY:
Yeah.
I think she was cast in this as more of a stunt performer.
But I think she was on, like, Babylon 5 as, like, a regular character.
One of those types of shows.

MIKE:
"It's a trick."
"Get an axe."

JAY:
Now here's a, here's a continuity thing.
She's facing away from him.
But now when we pan up, and we cut to this wide shot, she pops up from behind him.

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
Oh, I know it's great.
But, again, it doesn't matter.

RICH:
She's a demon.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
She can...

MIKE:
This, this is great, though.
This, this frantic, like, handheld camera.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's just so, so comical.

RICH:
I'm...
This is a terrible commentary, because I'm just watching this and smiling.

JAY:
That's true.

RICH:
Which is just, it's fucking awful for a commentary track.

JAY:
I love when Sam Raimi does these things, though, where there's, like, a whole sequence where every shot is done in this one particular...
Like this shot.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Every shot has that.
It's not, like, crazy, Michael Bay shaky cam...

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
It's following the shot.
It's just jittery until the sequence...

RICH:
Vibration.

JAY:
Until the, yeah.
Until the sequence is done.
And then when it's done, you know, we get a lock down shot like this.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's not, it's not, like, action movie exciting.
It's, it's almost...
There's, there's a specific style...

RICH:
If a scene has too much energy, and so the camera...

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
And here's, here's another one where every shot is a snap zoom for this little sequence.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This is, this is, uh...

JAY:
Remix the nonsensical robot arm.

RICH:
I hate the robot arm.

JAY:
I was disappointed because I was like,
"Oh, I wanted him to have the chainsaw through the whole movie."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And it never really comes back.

RICH:
I know why.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Yeah.
So he doesn't have to have a stump the whole movie.
And, yeah.
They indicate here it could crush a goblet.
But then he never really uses it for its crushing powers.

JAY:
No.

RICH:
This man is an engineering genius.
Why does he work at S-Mart?

MIKE:
Well, it was, it was the blacksmith that really built, built it, right?
Is he smart?

JAY:
He, he's smart when the movie needs him to be.

RICH:
He built that arm.

MIKE:
I guess, yeah.
He has a chemistry book that teaches him how to make gunpowder.

JAY:
That's true, yeah.

MIKE:
But he, he...
There's a line in this scene.
I wanna talk about this scene, um, where he's like, he's like,
"You'll never understand alloys and compositions and..."

JAY:
"Things with molecular structures."

MIKE:
Yeah.
Like, he doesn't know what he's talking about.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, but I love this scene, uh, rewatching it the other day, I was, like, it's the scene where they, where they have their bond.
They have a little fight.
They make up.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But it's so, like, shortened and almost self-aware.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Of, of the...

JAY:
Well, they don't make up.
He just walks up to her and they start kissing.

MIKE:
Exactly.
He's like,
"Give me that."

JAY:
They don't bond over anything in particular.

MIKE:
No.
Right.
It's, it's what would be a longer scene in a movie with more dialogue and more gravity and, you know, characterization.

JAY:
Get to know each other.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
His fiancee died yesterday.

MIKE:
"I, I made this, I made this for thee."
"I need another horse blanket."
And she slaps him.
And he says, uh,
"Give me some sugar, baby."

JAY:
"Give me some sugar, baby."

MIKE:
It's, it's like, it's like Sam Raimi knew this scene had to happen...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But he just didn't want to write a whole scene.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He just wrote, like, four lines.

JAY:
He tr-...
It's a joke.
The whole movie is a joke.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You're either in on it or you're not.

MIKE:
It's bordering on, like, a Naked Gun scene, you know what I mean?

JAY:
Yeah.
There's absolutely no reason.
Now she's, like, smitten.

MIKE:
Yeah.
She's gone from slapping him to making out with him because he just said "give me some sugar".
And he let her hair down.
That's it.
Now what's this story with this castle.
Is that a miniature or a matte painting or what?

JAY:
Uh, I think it's a miniature, but I'm not positive.
I mean, it's clearly composited in.
But, yeah.
I don't exactly know what it is.

RICH:
It's that castle from Southern California.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Here we are at Vasquez Rocks.

JAY:
Speaking of, yeah.
This is the famous Vasquez Rotch, Rocks, which is most well-known from being in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.

MIKE:
Uh-huh.

JAY:
It's, uh, nothing else.

MIKE:
Nothing else.

JAY:
And that actor is Ian Abercrombie, who's not known for anything else.

MIKE:
This is where Kirk fought the Gorn.
Rich knows that, though.

JAY:
Even I know that.

RICH:
I don't even need to say that.

JAY:
Ian Abercrombie was on Star Trek, right?
That guy has to have been on Star Trek at some point.

RICH:
Probably.
Everybody's been on fucking Star Trek.

JAY:
He's been on Star Trek.
I know him as Mr. Pitt, Elaine's boss on Seinfeld.
Yeah.
Look at Bruce Campbell's hair in this scene.

JAY:
It's, like, twice as long.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
