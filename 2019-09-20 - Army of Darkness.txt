MIKE:
Hello, and welcome to our commentary track for Army of Darkness.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
I'm Jay.

RICH:
I am Rich Evans.

JAY:
And that's Bruce Campbell's feet.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
And that's Bruce Campbell.

JAY:
And his, his stump that is stuck in that thing even though it makes no sense.

RICH:
So we're watching Army of Darkness.
And this is one of the worst movies ever made.
Let's all make fun of this movie.

MIKE:
When he says,
"My, my name is Ash, and I am a slave."
Is that a reference to something?
Is that, like, the opening line of something famous?

JAY:
Not that I know of.

MIKE:
I always thought it was, and I've never looked it up, because it's such an odd line.

JAY:
It is.
It is.

MIKE:
It sounds like it's, uh...
I don't know.

JAY:
Well, you'll notice here, the housewares department, like, the sign placement and everything looks different than it does at the end of the film because this was a part of the original filming, and the ending was a re-shoot.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
The re-done ending.
And that was Bridget Fonda, for some reason.

RICH:
She wanted to be in Evil Dead.

JAY:
I think she just, yeah.
She's a fan.
It makes sense.
She ends up in, uh, A Simple Plan later.
Sam Raimi put her in another movie.
Um, but I was gonna say, it would make sense if it was, like, Holly Hunter or something because there was a period of time when, like, Sam Raimi and the Coen Brothers and, like, Holly Hunter all lived in a house together.
Like, when they were all starting out in Hollywood.
But this is footage from Evil Dead II.
This opening re-cap of the, the first two Evil Dead movies is a combination of footage from Evil Dead II and, uh, re-shot stuff.
Like, when he cuts his hand off, it's a re-shoot, because they didn't want to be as bloody.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's one thing I, I, I noticed watching this movie is that it has an R-rating.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
It really shouldn't.

JAY:
It shouldn't.
They tr-, they made it with the intention of it being PG-13, but for whatever reason the ratings board just kept coming back with an R.

MIKE:
Oh, really?

JAY:
And that...

MIKE:
I could think of one particular scene that made it, makes it R.
But, uh...
He's, because he says "fuck" once.

JAY:
You can say "fuck" once in a PG-13, yeah.

MIKE:
He's said,
"Get the fuck out of my way."
When he, when he's coming back with the book.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, I would, I would, I would venture to guess it's the, the fountain of human blood that gives it the R-rating.

JAY:
The, the fountain of Kool-Aid, you mean?

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then they said,
"Yeah, you can't show that."

RICH:
You know, my, my, my mother used to love horror movies.
And she'd have us watch horror movies all the time.
And I, I vaguely remember watching this with her as a kid.
And she didn't know it was a sequel to Evil Dead II.
And we got to this, and she's like,
"Oh, it's the guy from that movie."

JAY:
Well, that's, that's the most baffling thing, is that this movie, it wasn't produced by Universal Pictures.
It was, like, picked up for U.S. distribution by Universal.
But the idea that they thought they could market it as just, like, a standalone movie is so baffling.

MIKE:
Was there, like, just talks of calling it Evil Dead III?

JAY:
Uh, well, I think Sam Raimi wanted to call it The Medieval Dead.
Which is very clever.

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
But, no.
It's just Army of Darkness.
I, I think they kind of wanted it to sort of work as a standalone movie, but, I mean, all this opening is just, like, if it was just, just its own movie...

MIKE:
I always hate that...

JAY:
It's just all so baffling.

MIKE:
Sorry.
I always hate that you kid see those boards.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
It drives me nuts.

JAY:
That was a shot from Evil Dead II.
And then we cut to this shot, which was shot for Army of Darkness.
And, like, the color temperature's completely different.

MIKE:
Oh, right.

JAY:
The location isn't the same at all.

MIKE:
What, what shot was that from, Evil Dead II?

JAY:
That's the end of Evil Dead II.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, that's right.
The original ending.
And then they, they...
What happens?
They, uh...

JAY:
A horrible flying hag monster flies in and Ash shoots its head off.

MIKE:
And he shoots it.
It's like a truncated version of this opening.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's right.

JAY:
Well, the truncated version of the whole movie.
Because then they're like,
"Heil he who has come from the sky."

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And then he goes...

JAY:
And then kind of happens later in this.

MIKE:
He starts going,
"No!"
"No!"
"No!"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.

JAY:
It's a great ending.

MIKE:
That's right.
That's right.
It's been a while since I've seen Evil Dead II.

JAY:
This is one of the most bizarre series of movies ever made, as far as none of them being similar in any way tonally.

RICH:
Do people generally like this more than Evil Dead II?

JAY:
Um, I think Evil Dead II is the most well-liked.

RICH:
Yeah?

JAY:
Well, it's the best.

RICH:
It is.

JAY:
But we're, we're talking about Army of Darkness.
But Evil Dead II is the best, I, in my opinion.
But that's the thing is, like, you have Evil Dead, which is super cheap and rough around the edges, but it's basically a straight horror movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Evil Dead II, which is like a weirdo horror comedy.
And then this, which is more of, like, an adventure slapstick comedy.
There's not a whole lot of horror in this film.

MIKE:
This is the Gremlins 2 of the Gremlins series.

JAY:
Yes.
Yes.

MIKE:
It gets very Looney Tunes.

RICH:
So does Evil Dead II, honestly.

MIKE:
It does, yeah.

JAY:
But still, as a horror film...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
The, this, I mean, this is just pure goofiness.

RICH:
Well, the whole pretext has been dropped.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
There's no, uh, Three Stooges bit in Evil Dead II, as far as I remember.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Technically, there is.

MIKE:
There is?
Oh.
What?
What is that, Jay?

JAY:
When, when the, when the, uh, creature in the basement, when they, they stomp on its head, and its eyeball pops out.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
And it lands in the l-, the little girl's mouth.
That's directly from a Three Stooges movie.
But it works as a horror sequence as well.
A very silly one.
But, yeah.
But this one is, like, goofy comical skeletons poking him in the eyes.
It's nonsense.

MIKE:
Wow.
Europe really looks like Southern California.
I guess they could be in, like, like, Spain or something.

RICH:
Well, that's not very likely.

MIKE:
Now I never noticed this until I, I watched this is Blu-ray, but, uh, Henry the Red and all of his men are, are gingers.

JAY:
I don't think I ever noticed that either.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
They're all redheads.

JAY:
That's pretty funny.

MIKE:
God bless high-definition.

JAY:
You can still find new things in, in stupid old movies.

MIKE:
It's a joke against redheaded people.
I guess.

JAY:
We have Arthur and, uh, Sheila, who are, like, the only people that treat this movie seriously.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The rest of the movie is just a gigantic joke.
Children just beating him up.

MIKE:
I don't know why I saw this stuff as just so funny.
I think it's just performance.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
This, this is, this is...

MIKE:
"Ow!"
"Cut it out!"

JAY:
As far as a comedic performance goes, this is my favorite Bruce Campbell performance.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
As far as a physical performance, probably Evil Dead II when he's doing all the, when his hand's possessed, and he's, you know, flipping himself over in the kitchen and everything.
But as far just a straight...
I mean, this is what kind of cemented the Bruce Campbell persona...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The sort of cocky, but also incredibly dumb.
Which is also another interesting thing about this series in that each iteration, Ash just gets dumber.
First, first movie, he's, like, college guy.
Second movie, he's a little silly.
And then this is, like, nonsense.
And then, Ash vs Evil Dead, he's even dumber.

MIKE:
I don't know if I'd call him dumb, so much as selfish and...

JAY:
Overly cocky.

MIKE:
Monstrous.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Was Big Trouble in Little China an influence?

JAY:
Um, I don't know.
I've never heard it being an influence as far as anything I've read from Sam Raimi.

RICH:
It's similar where you take, like, an action hero protagonist, but he's also kind of an incompetent boob.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's true.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's very reminiscient of that, sure.

JAY:
I don't, yeah.
I don't know if it was an intentional influence or not.
This feels more...
That's the weird thing about this movie.
It's like this big adventure, you know, time travel swashbuckling thing.
And then Sam Raimi's just like,
"The lead will be Bruce Campbell."

RICH:
Well that's, that's your gimmick..

JAY:
The whole, the whole movie's a joke.
Which is again why it's weird that, like, you kind of have to be in on the joke to get the movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, did either of you see this in the theater?

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
You did?
Oh, okay.
I thought I might be the only one.

MIKE:
No.
A friend of mine was into Evil Dead...

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
And Evil Dead II.
And then, yeah.
I think I saw this at the dollar show.

JAY:
I mentioned it because my dad took me to see it, because it was rated-R, so I couldn't get in.
And I was really excited to check it out.
And at the end of the movie, he just goes,
"I don't know what the hell was happening in that entire movie."

MIKE:
It's pretty clear, though.

JAY:
I think it, maybe it was the tone threw him off.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because it's like,
"What is this?"
It's, like, nonsense.

RICH:
It's basically an in-joke.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
And that's what crazy is, like, Universal tried to sell...
Because I, how I found out about this movie was, uh, through the trailer that said, like, "From Sam Raimi, director of Dark Man."
And I liked Dark Man.
Uh, but I didn't know what this was.
And then I read in Fangoria that it was a sequel to these Evil Dead movies.

RICH:
Did Dark Man come out before this?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Holy shit.

JAY:
Cou-, couple years before it.
Which also makes this movie funnier, because it's like,
"Oh, Sam Raimi has a modest hit with Dark Man."
"He's gonna follow it up with this Evil Dead sequel."

RICH:
Dark Man is underrated.

JAY:
I like Dark Man a lot.
Sam, Sam Raimi's first attempt at a slightly off-kilter comic book movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then he shoots scenes like this with the arrow.

JAY:
The camera's following the arrow.
Well, this is, yeah.

MIKE:
He sped up, like, like, cartoon, like, uh...

JAY:
It's classic Sam Raimi stuff.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's full...

MIKE:
I love shots like this where there, there's a lot of scenes like this where the camera moves, and all these characters either come into frame.
Um, this just super long...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Camera move.
There's one where, after he defeats everybody, or the bad guys, the camera's moving back, and all these main characters are kind of stepping into frame, one after the other.

JAY:
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
There's, there's really cinematic shots, and then there's slapstick nonsense.

JAY:
Lock down the camera and throw rubber skeletons at Bruce Campbell.

MIKE:
Right.
Right.
Right.
For ten minutes of, uh, slapstick with skeleton hands hitting him in the eyes.
And, uh, Looney Tunes sound effects.

JAY:
A very famous sound effect later on in the movie that we'll have to point out when it gets there.

MIKE:
What, Wilhelm scream?

JAY:
No.
No.

MIKE:
Oh.
Kurlan naiskos?

JAY:
Yeah.
The classic pottery-breaking sound effect makes an appearance.

RICH:
So, why didn't Bruce Campbell become a bigger star?
Obviously, he's big in the right circles.

JAY:
Yeah.
He's big in b-movie circles.

RICH:
But he was never a big star.
And why isn't, why isn't that the case?
He's funny as fuck.

JAY:
I don't know.
It just never really happened.

MIKE:
Is he a good actor-actor?

RICH:
Well, you don't put him in, in, like, serious dramatic roles.
You find a goofy comedy, and you put him in that.

MIKE:
Like a, like a buddy cop movie kind of thing?

RICH:
Sure.

MIKE:
I guess so.

JAY:
He's got the leading man looks.
Like, he looks like an action star.
Oh, look.
You can see the woman's head on the side of the frame.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
You can see her hair a little bit there.
This is a great little set, too.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
You can see her laying down.
Look at that.
This movie's a mess.

RICH:
It's terrible.
I told you when this started, this is the worst movie.

JAY:
It's true.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
There's so many mistakes...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And bad things in this movie.

JAY:
Well, that's, that's part of...
I mean, it's kind of like Martin Scorcese with his editing, where it's like...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's not concerned about continuity.
He's just concerned about the flow of the scene.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
And Sam Raimi is, is just definitely doesn't care about continuity or little minor errors.
It's all about just what, what works for the gag.

MIKE:
Right.
So I don't know if this is some kind of...
Is this some kind of Indiana Jones homage?
He does the belt whip thing.

JAY:
Well, I was gonna ask about that when it happens.

MIKE:
It's pointless.

JAY:
It's pointless.

MIKE:
Because he could just...

JAY:
Like, why doesn't he just grab the chain?

MIKE:
He could grab onto the chain.
So it seems, like, almost, like...
Oh, this, this is the best moment in the whole movie.

RICH:
It, it makes it slightly more exciting and action-y.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I know.
He, he, because he, yeah.
It adds tension.
The belt could break.

JAY:
Yeah.
I suppose.

MIKE:
But it doesn't, it doesn't make sense.

JAY:
Not at all.
But it works in the moment, which is Sam Raimi's whole thing.

MIKE:
Whoop!

JAY:
See, now, like, this, if you watch this as a standalone movie, that opening recap that tries to set everything up does not explain the chainsaw arm at all.

MIKE:
Well, the, the, the wizard finds it and holds it up.

JAY:
But the, but why it...

RICH:
Why it exists.

JAY:
Is fitted for his stump.
None of it makes any sense.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Look at that great shot through the middle of the spikes.

MIKE:
He explains that he has to cut off his hand.
That's explained in the recap.

JAY:
Yeah.
They explain that.
But they don't explain why he has a chainsaw that fits right on there.
This is a great monster.
It's a shame that it doesn't have any articulation.

MIKE:
That's true.

JAY:
It's essentially a Halloween costume.

MIKE:
He was a Halloween storehand.
It sticks to get that guy's face.

JAY:
Do you, do you know who's in this monster costume?

MIKE:
I do not.
Sam Raimi?

JAY:
No.

RICH:
Sam Raimi?

JAY:
I don't know the actor's name, but it's the same guy that played the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

RICH:
Oh.

JAY:
In Ghostbusters, yeah.

MIKE:
Wow.

JAY:
Yeah.
Like, here, he's holding the chain.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But then in the close-up, he's not.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
It's all just a bunch of nonsense.

MIKE:
That's why with the spikes coming in and the, like...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I don't know.
Have you listened to the reel commentary for this, Jay?

JAY:
I have.
It's been a long time.
But they don't explain that.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Because that was one of my main questions.

MIKE:
Or how this guy...

JAY:
When it comes to questions of logic, they usually don't bother explaining those in the Sam Raimi commentaries.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He doesn't care.

MIKE:
"Listen up, you primitive screw-heads."
He has so many great lines in this.
And that was, like, my, my youth, just repeating every line from this movie.

JAY:
Yeah.
This was...
I, I may have seen this movie more than any other movie ever.
Because there was a period when it first came out on home video, I watched it, like, every day after school for, like, six months.
This is one of those ones where I knew, like, every sound effect, even.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
One of those.

MIKE:
Yep.
"You wanna little?"
"You want some?"

JAY:
Had either of you seen the other Evil Dead movies before this?

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
You did?

RICH:
I did not.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Again, I had a friend who was really into this...

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
And they would always say,
"Dead by dawn!"
"Dead by dawn!"

JAY:
Yeah.
I, I had...
Like, I d-, I just saw the trailer for this before something, and I knew it was the guy who did Dark Man.
And that was all I knew.
But then before it came out, I was reading in Fangoria -- they had an article about it -- and they mentioned that it was a sequel to the Evil Dead movies.
So I was like,
"Oh, before I see this, I gotta watch those other ones, I guess."

RICH:
I just remember there was a moderate amount of hype around it.

JAY:
There was?
For this?

RICH:
Well, it depends on who you knew.

JAY:
Yeah.
I guess, yeah.
Depends on certain people.
But I know this was, like, a giant bomb when it came out because nobody knew what the hell it was.
But I had a, yeah, a weekend, like, before we went and saw this where we rented the, the first two movies and watched 'em back-to-back, and it was a magical time.
The, the Evil Dead trilogy kind of changed my life.
This was, like, the series that made me kind of made me understand what a filmmaker was.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
Because the style is so broad...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That it's, like, that was where I was like,
"Oh, somebody made these decisions."
"Like, these shots and all the, the, the creativity and the weirdness."
I was like,
"Somebody made this."

MIKE:
"The sword boy's job."

JAY:
Then he just kicks him down.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
Like, the pacing of this moment where he shoots the top of his sword off, and then it cuts to all these different reaction shots, and just, like, the shot of the, uh, flag.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, the, the pacing of it is all so perfect.
This is sort of a POV shot.
Kind of.

MIKE:
It's like it's a gun POV.
All the little, all the little...
The people look so small and, like, they look like, like, I don't know.
Tribal people...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Looking at something.

JAY:
Yeah.
They're looking at it like it's a, like, a deity or something.

MIKE:
Right.
Yes.
He's establishing his power.
Standing on something raises him above everybody else.

JAY:
Despite the fact that he's a complete buffoon.
That's the, that's the fun of this in that it, it becomes even more prominent in Ash vs Evil Dead, is that he's a complete buffoon about everything killing monsters.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
He's a badass when it comes to killing demons.

MIKE:
He's just a guy that wants to get home, Jay.

JAY:
He's just a complete selfish asshole.
Which, again, they build up even more in Ash vs Evil Dead.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This scene particularly demonstrates that.
Look how he's sitting on that.

JAY:
It's funny, too, like, I think...
Because this was, like, a re-shoot.
Like, they didn't do this when they initially shot the movie.
So if you look at Arthur's beard here...

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
It's, like, like, glued on.
It's like a cheap fake beard.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And this set's so tiny.
I don't know if they shot it or they ran out of money or what, but there was the comic book adaptation that was what this scene was originally supposed to be.
It was, like, this big room with all these pillars.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And the witch lady that comes up was knocking the pillars, and they were going down like dominoes.
Like, it was this big, elaborate thing.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
And here, we just get, like, a two-wall set.

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
It's like a, like a high school play.
Did they not shoot that scene?
They just ran out of money?

JAY:
I, I don't know.
It was kind of unclear.
I think they, like, just ran out of money or something and they didn't shoot it.
But that was the original idea for this scene.
And then they ended up filming it later.
There's a couple scenes they shot later, you can see when they're by, like, Vasquez Rocks, that Ash's hair is longer than it is in the rest of the movie.

MIKE:
Mm.
And...snap zoom.

JAY:
Yeah!
A classic hag.
Evil Dead hag monster.

MIKE:
"You shall die!"

JAY:
And this witch lady is, uh, Patricia Tallman, who is, like, an actress and stuntperson.
She started with, like, George Romero's camp.
She's in, like, George Romero's Knightrider, and she played Barbara in the Night of the Living Dead remake.

MIKE:
Oh.

RICH:
Oh.

JAY:
Yeah.
I think she was cast in this as more of a stunt performer.
But I think she was on, like, Babylon 5 as, like, a regular character.
One of those types of shows.

MIKE:
"It's a trick."
"Get an axe."

JAY:
Now here's a, here's a continuity thing.
She's facing away from him.
But now when we pan up, and we cut to this wide shot, she pops up from behind him.

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
Oh, I know it's great.
But, again, it doesn't matter.

RICH:
She's a demon.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
She can...

MIKE:
This, this is great, though.
This, this frantic, like, handheld camera.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's just so, so comical.

RICH:
I'm...
This is a terrible commentary, because I'm just watching this and smiling.

JAY:
That's true.

RICH:
Which is just, it's fucking awful for a commentary track.

JAY:
I love when Sam Raimi does these things, though, where there's, like, a whole sequence where every shot is done in this one particular...
Like this shot.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Every shot has that.
It's not, like, crazy, Michael Bay shaky cam...

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
It's following the shot.
It's just jittery until the sequence...

RICH:
Vibration.

JAY:
Until the, yeah.
Until the sequence is done.
And then when it's done, you know, we get a lock down shot like this.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's not, it's not, like, action movie exciting.
It's, it's almost...
There's, there's a specific style...

RICH:
If a scene has too much energy, and so the camera...

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
And here's, here's another one where every shot is a snap zoom for this little sequence.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This is, this is, uh...

JAY:
Remix the nonsensical robot arm.

RICH:
I hate the robot arm.

JAY:
I was disappointed because I was like,
"Oh, I wanted him to have the chainsaw through the whole movie."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And it never really comes back.

RICH:
I know why.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Yeah.
So he doesn't have to have a stump the whole movie.
And, yeah.
They indicate here it could crush a goblet.
But then he never really uses it for its crushing powers.

JAY:
No.

RICH:
This man is an engineering genius.
Why does he work at S-Mart?

MIKE:
Well, it was, it was the blacksmith that really built, built it, right?
Is he smart?

JAY:
He, he's smart when the movie needs him to be.

RICH:
He built that arm.

MIKE:
I guess, yeah.
He has a chemistry book that teaches him how to make gunpowder.

JAY:
That's true, yeah.

MIKE:
But he, he...
There's a line in this scene.
I wanna talk about this scene, um, where he's like, he's like,
"You'll never understand alloys and compositions and..."

JAY:
"Things with molecular structures."

MIKE:
Yeah.
Like, he doesn't know what he's talking about.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, but I love this scene, uh, rewatching it the other day, I was, like, it's the scene where they, where they have their bond.
They have a little fight.
They make up.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But it's so, like, shortened and almost self-aware.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Of, of the...

JAY:
Well, they don't make up.
He just walks up to her and they start kissing.

MIKE:
Exactly.
He's like,
"Give me that."

JAY:
They don't bond over anything in particular.

MIKE:
No.
Right.
It's, it's what would be a longer scene in a movie with more dialogue and more gravity and, you know, characterization.

JAY:
Get to know each other.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
His fiancee died yesterday.

MIKE:
"I, I made this, I made this for thee."
"I need another horse blanket."
And she slaps him.
And he says, uh,
"Give me some sugar, baby."

JAY:
"Give me some sugar, baby."

MIKE:
It's, it's like, it's like Sam Raimi knew this scene had to happen...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But he just didn't want to write a whole scene.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He just wrote, like, four lines.

JAY:
He tr-...
It's a joke.
The whole movie is a joke.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You're either in on it or you're not.

MIKE:
It's bordering on, like, a Naked Gun scene, you know what I mean?

JAY:
Yeah.
There's absolutely no reason.
Now she's, like, smitten.

MIKE:
Yeah.
She's gone from slapping him to making out with him because he just said "give me some sugar".
And he let her hair down.
That's it.
Now what's this story with this castle.
Is that a miniature or a matte painting or what?

JAY:
Uh, I think it's a miniature, but I'm not positive.
I mean, it's clearly composited in.
But, yeah.
I don't exactly know what it is.

RICH:
It's that castle from Southern California.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Here we are at Vasquez Rocks.

JAY:
Speaking of, yeah.
This is the famous Vasquez Rotch, Rocks, which is most well-known from being in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.

MIKE:
Uh-huh.

JAY:
It's, uh, nothing else.

MIKE:
Nothing else.

JAY:
And that actor is Ian Abercrombie, who's not known for anything else.

MIKE:
This is where Kirk fought the Gorn.
Rich knows that, though.

JAY:
Even I know that.

RICH:
I don't even need to say that.

JAY:
Ian Abercrombie was on Star Trek, right?
That guy has to have been on Star Trek at some point.

RICH:
Probably.
Everybody's been on fucking Star Trek.

JAY:
He's been on Star Trek.
I know him as Mr. Pitt, Elaine's boss on Seinfeld.
Yeah.
Look at Bruce Campbell's hair in this scene.

JAY:
It's, like, twice as long.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Here we get some more kind of moody Evil Dead, uh, stuff.
Someone has a smoke machine just off-camera.

RICH:
Honestly, this is where the movie kind of falls apart for me.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
The second act's bad.

RICH:
Yeah.
Second act's terrible.

MIKE:
We'll, we'll talk about that.

JAY:
Oh, there's lots of fun stuff in the second act.

RICH:
Yeah.
But the, the fun stuff, though, with the whole premise is h-, of him going back into time is him interacting with people from the past.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's true.

RICH:
You have this whole section in the middle of the movie where he's just on his own.

JAY:
See, my favorite stuff in Evil Dead II is when he's by himself and just going crazy in the cabin and it's just, like, the Bruce Campbell show.

RICH:
Sure.
But you can watch Evil Dead II for that.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I think, I think these scenes just kind of waste the premise.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
Yes.
I agree with Rich.

JAY:
That's fair.

MIKE:
Uh, because Evil Dead II...
We'll just talk about Evil Dead II.
Um, that built, that, that's, like, the, that's what it revolves around...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Is him in the cabin.

JAY:
Going crazy, yeah.

MIKE:
Um, this is, and then this feels like the second act needed Evil Dead stuff.
Like, this, like, the, the camera following...

JAY:
The famous Evil Dead point-of-view shots.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then the banging on the door, and all, and then...
I hate the little Ash's.
Um...

JAY:
I like the idea behind 'em, but the execution of it is...

MIKE:
The execution is, yeah.

RICH:
I openly hate that whole sequence of the movie.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I do.
I do.

JAY:
Too...silly?
To be taken too far?

RICH:
Just too, too wrong for this movie.

JAY:
Mm.

RICH:
For what this movie should be.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Yeah.
His quest needed to, uh, to find the book.
Needed a couple scenes with him going to things you've seen in medieval movies, right?

RICH:
He needed a posse with him of, of, like...

MIKE:
Sure.

RICH:
Arthur and whoever else.

MIKE:
Robin and his Merry Men kind of thing?

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"We've gotta go to this village, and, uh..."

JAY:
Maybe all these obstacles he has to face...

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Along the way to the main...
Yeah.

MIKE:
I think at one point someone says,
"We'll be safe with the elves."
Towards the end when they're...

JAY:
"We'll be safe in the hills."

MIKE:
Oh, okay.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Wait.
Scratch that then.

JAY:
That would be great, though, if they open this up to more of a fantasy world.

MIKE:
Well, sure.

JAY:
Ash in a Lord of the Rings movie.

MIKE:
Um, yeah.
Like, what would you do, Rich?
What, what, what would you do?

RICH:
I, I...

MIKE:
What's a trope from...

RICH:
Oh, geez.

MIKE:
Like, uh, uh, like a, he's gotta battle a knight?
A jousting tournament?

RICH:
You're really putting me on the spot.
Um...
Ooh, ooh.
Some kind of wizard asking him riddles.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
There you go.

MIKE:
A guy at a bridge asking...
Like, what's in, um, uh, uh, uh, the fucking Monty Python movie?

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
There's the guy who gets all of his limbs cut off where he has to, he's guarding the bridge or whatever.

MIKE:
Right.
Yes.
He needs, he needs the three, uh...

JAY:
Or Deathstalker II, when Deathstalker has to get in a wrestling match with the woman from Glow.

MIKE:
There you go.
He's gotta find three, three magic stones that will open the door that the, the Necronomicon is behind, right?
And, uh, he's gotta joust.
A jousting tournament.
Um, he ends up on the gallows, right?

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, let's see.
What else could we do?
But you're right.
You're right.
Generally speaking, the interaction with, like, when he's yelling at all the people, telling them what the shotgun type is.

RICH:
Right.

MIKE:
That's fun stuff.
This, uh, this Looney Tunes stuff, I don't know.
These, these, these large-scale minature sets are kind of neat.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think as an isolated sequence, this is kind of fun.
Even though the effects, the compositing, is not great at all.
Just th-, just be thankful we're watching the U.S. theatrical cut.
Because the international cut, this is, like, twice as long.

MIKE:
Oh, no.

JAY:
They drop a bucket on his head, and there's some slapstick with that.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This, this sort of seems like they wanted to recreate some of this...

RICH:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Weird stuff.

RICH:
I, I get that.
I understand why they'd want to do that, because Evil Dead II is arguably the best movie ever made.

JAY:
And yet we're here doing the commentary for Army of Darkness instead.

RICH:
Declaring any movie your favorite is always silly because your favorite movie could change depending upon your mood, but...

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Evil Dead II, it's, it's in the mix there for me.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
That's fair.
I do like the...
He almost says it sarcastically when he wakes up and he's like,
"What a horrible nightmare."
It's, the whole situation is just too stupid.

MIKE:
A little, uh, Gulliver's Travels thing, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I guess the point of the...

JAY:
Oh, look at those wires.
Oh, man.
HD has not done this movie kind.
You can see the little matte around where the thing jumps into his mouth.

MIKE:
Yeah.
With them holding his nose looked terrible.
The effects in this movie are not good.
But, but that's not the point.

JAY:
Some of 'em are fun.
It's not like Evil Dead II, where all the effects, it's, it's like the perfect use of everything.
Of, like, stop-motion and creature effects and...
This, this one, I think they got a little too...
I mean, I'm fine with them going ambitious, because that kind of makes the movie funnier.

MIKE:
So here he's pouring boiling hot water down his throat to burn the guy.
But he does not burn his mouth.
I used to always think like,
"Oh, that's how he got his, the Evil Ash, got his face fucked up."
"He got burnt in the stomach."
And then I always forget that he...
Oh, he comes out normal.

JAY:
And then he shoots him in the face with a shotgun.

MIKE:
Shot in the face with a shotgun.

JAY:
I like this shot coming up here.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
The eyeball.

MIKE:
It's so gross.

JAY:
But then, instead of any effects to see the thing growing out of him, just ADR a line where he says it's getting bigger.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
You think there's a smoke machine right off-frame?

MIKE:
I think so.

RICH:
Do you suppose Universal was watching, like, the dailies of this and just thinking,
"Oh, god."
"What have we done?"

JAY:
Well, that's...
No.
This wasn't made by Universal.

MIKE:
No.
They just distributed.

RICH:
Oh, they did.

JAY:
It was a, uh, yeah.
They picked it up after it was already made.

RICH:
Okay.

JAY:
But the fact that they watched the finish movie and said,
"We can sell this!"
Is pretty amazing.

MIKE:
No.
Sam Raimi made this in his backyard, Rich.
With his friends on the weekend.

JAY:
I think Universal was maybe hoping that because Dark Man was a decent, uh, success, that maybe they could get more of that audience.
Yeah.
I like in Evil Dead II, the more, like, when his reflection comes out of the mirror, and he's, like, tormenting himself.
That's a little more psychological.
This is just goofiness.
And that rubber tree just completely wiggled when he hit it.

RICH:
No.
No.
The force of the impact was so severe that it...

JAY:
It ripped the roots.

RICH:
It rocked, it rocked a normal tree.

MIKE:
I always used to say,
"Why, why didn't he have a, like a line right before he shoots him in the face?"
Because he's saving it.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And he says,
"Good?"
"Bad?"
"I'm the guy with the gun."
Couldn't do two lines.
And here's, here's the recreation of the, uh, Evil Dead II scene.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
This is more in-line with the tone.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
This particular series of shots.
Certainly not little Ash's.

JAY:
Yeah.
I guess Ash cuts him up here.
They kind of got rid of the idea that you have to completely dismember them in this movie.
Because all the, the demons he's killed so far at this point, he just kind of shoots 'em.

RICH:
That's pretty painstaking.

JAY:
That was part of the whole mythology in the other movies.

RICH:
I think, I think peasants just come in later and hack the bodies up.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.
We just don't see that.

RICH:
Yeah.
We don't see it.

JAY:
That's fair.
That would eat up a lot of screentime in this 80-minute movie.

MIKE:
That was, like, a perfect match cut, by the way.
The dumping...

JAY:
Oh.
From dumping it?

MIKE:
Dumping, dumping of the body and the fake head that turns and then it cuts to a close-up.

JAY:
Yeah.
And he always builds crosses.
In all these movies.
I never understood it.

MIKE:
Oh.
At their graves?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I think it's just to indicate that he's buried them in a grave.

JAY:
Sure.

RICH:
Well, that, it becomes a great joke in Ash vs Evil Dead.

JAY:
They...
That's right.
They make a joke about that.

MIKE:
We should talk about the music.
The music's amazing in this movie.

RICH:
We're listening to it with the sound off.
I can't even fucking hear it.

MIKE:
Oh.
You're right.

JAY:
Yeah.
Main theme by Danny Elfman.
And then the rest of the score is Joe LoDuca, who's done all of these movies.

MIKE:
Is there a Michael De Luca?
Is that, like, a brother that...

JAY:
There is a Michael De Luca.
I don't think they're related, though.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
I don't think so.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Michael De Luca was a New Line Cinema executive.

MIKE:
Oh.
Okay.
Maybe they were brothers, Jay.

JAY:
I mean, anything's possible.

MIKE:
There's no way to find this out.

JAY:
There's absolutely no way to, to get this information.
These are some fun moody shots.

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
I like this one with the skull opening.

MIKE:
"Wait a minute."
"Nobody said anything about three books."

JAY:
See.
This is kind of what you're talking about, where he has to have his little challenges.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's a bit quest-y, but we need some interactions.

JAY:
Sure.
Not, not spend the last fifteen minutes completely by himself?

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
It's fine.
This is...

RICH:
It could be better.

MIKE:
Rich and I just hate the windmill.
We hate the windmill and everything to do with it.

JAY:
That's fair.

MIKE:
It's a small p-, portion of the movie.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It has a great, great first act, and a great last act.

RICH:
A really great first act, though.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's definitely the strongest stuff in the movie.

MIKE:
Everything is perfect about it.
The battle, the battle's epic.
There are some problems.

JAY:
You gotta put "epic" in qoutes.
It's epic for an Evil Dead movie.
I like that that shot of him going into the book is just a snap zoom of him standing there with his arms in front of him.
It doesn't even move.
That's all it is.

MIKE:
That's a great makeup appliance, though.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
That's not his real face being stretched?

MIKE:
No.
That there is...

JAY:
Now they...
I know they...
There's the international cut, where this goes on a little bit longer.
In this truncated U.S. cut, it's actually funnier how he's shaking his head and just hard-cut to him...
I think it's after this one.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Where he just starts talking.
I vividly remember seeing this in the theater and everybody laughing at the movie at that point.

MIKE:
How do you know what they were laughing at?

JAY:
It's possible they were in on the joke.
But I don't think so.

MIKE:
I think you're supposed to laugh at this movie.

JAY:
No.
You laugh at movies that aren't aware of how ridiculous they are.

MIKE:
Well, this movie is.

JAY:
This movie is aware of how ridiculous it is.

MIKE:
Oh.
So you...

JAY:
So you're laughing with it.

MIKE:
Okay.
Well, you said the audience is laughing at it.

JAY:
I, I think the audience that I saw it with was laughing at it.

MIKE:
Oh.
Like they thought it was supposed to be serious?

JAY:
Like they didn't know what they were getting into.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I guess.

JAY:
Which is why this movie was a big flop.

MIKE:
Normally, with, like, failed comedy, you just kind of sit there in awkward silence.

RICH:
Because they were too dumb to realize it was a real comedy.

MIKE:
That's true.
This movie is very smart.
It's very self-aware.

JAY:
I don't like the, uh, new look of the Necronomicon in this, though.

MIKE:
Why is that?

JAY:
I don't know.
It looks too clean.
I like the, the janky Evil Dead II book.
This one looks too cons-...

RICH:
Flat.

JAY:
It's, it looks too constructed.
Like, the whole idea is that it was, like, bound in human flesh.
And here, it looks like somebody sculpted that cover, as opposed to just being a face that's awkwardly stretched over the front of it.

MIKE:
I remember you had a version of this movie that was made from the Necronomicon.
You did, Jay.

JAY:
No.
I had Evil Dead II.

MIKE:
Oh.
That.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
F-, it was foam latex.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, and it just started falling apart.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, six weeks after you bought it.

JAY:
That thing was, that was, like, a gimmick.
That thing was not built to last.
They had one for Evil Dead and Evil Dead II.

RICH:
How much did they charge for?

JAY:
I don't remember.
This was, like, fifteen years ago.

MIKE:
They got his money, though.

JAY:
I don't, I don't know if any series of movies has been re-released more than these three.

RICH:
You know, the Necronomicon would be a fun replica prop.

JAY:
Oh, sure.

MIKE:
I've seen the real thing in real life, Rich.

RICH:
You know, people send us weird crap all the time.
If you want to send us something weird and artsy, send us a fucking Necronomicon.

JAY:
Rich didn't even hear what you said.

RICH:
What was that?

JAY:
You were about to tell an amazing story.

MIKE:
I've seen the real thing in real life.

RICH:
Oh.
Oh.
My god.
When?

MIKE:
Did I ever tell my, my, my Tom, uh, uh...

JAY:
Tom Sullivan?

MIKE:
Tom Sullivan story...

JAY:
I don't think so.

MIKE:
In any of our programmings?

RICH:
Go ahead.
I'm right here.

MIKE:
Oh.
Well, I guess, yeah.
Nothing much happens here.

JAY:
These graves popping out is fun.

MIKE:
Uh, uh, so early 2000's, mid-2000's, early 2000's, 2004...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I think.
I was at the, the, the Phoenix Horror Convention.

JAY:
The famous Joe Pilato convention.

MIKE:
The famous Joe Pilato convention.
This was a convention.
It was the first annual Horror Convention in Phoenix, Arizona.
And it was, it was very well mis-, it was mismanaged, um, where they didn't advertise it well.
And they had, like, 50 big horror movie stars and, like, 100 people came over, like, two days.
So literally there was just rows and rows of, uh, famous horror people.
I could list them all here, but it would take too long.
I gotta tell my story.
My Tom Sullivan story.
Um, and I just bought a new camera.
It was a Canon Digital Rebel.
I was taking pictures of everything.
I've lost all these photos, by the way.

JAY:
That's unfortunate.

MIKE:
It's very unfortunate because we walked around and we took pictures with everybody.
Stars of Dawn of the Dead.
Stuart Gordon was there.
Dee Wallace.
Everybody.
The who's who of horror movies was there.
And Tom Sullivan, the artist who created the drawings in the Evil Dead book.

JAY:
From the original movie.

MIKE:
From the original movie, yeah.
Um, and he was there, and he had his own station.
He does his own original art, and I just, I took pictures of everything.
I took pictures of all of his stuff, and how it was laid out because I was just bored.
And, um, at one point, uh, he starts, like, our table was just a little bit aways from his.
And he just starts freaking out.
And we're like,
"What's wrong with him?"
You know?
And, um, and then it turns out that he was, he was having p-, a panic attack because someone had stolen one of the pages from the Evil Dead book.
And it was the page with the skull.

JAY:
That's the most iconic one.

MIKE:
The most iconic one.
And he...
Because he had 'em all laid out on this table.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And, um, for people to look at.
Um, and he was just, like, watching everything.
So then, like, the police show up because he called the cops.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
And then, um, I'm like,
"What's going on with Tom Sullivan?"
They're like,
"He called the cops."
"Someone stole a page from the Necronomicon."
And he's like, he's like,
"Aughhh!"
And I was like,
"I just took pictures of it."
And so I took my camera, and I used the A/V outs, and I plugged it into a TV that, that we had at our table, and I start cycling through all my pictures.
And Tom Sullivan comes over, and the cops are there, and they're like,
"What page was it?"
And, and he's watching.
Tom Sullivan's watching.
And he's, he's like,
"Uh, it's that one!"
"That's the missing page!"
And it was a skull page.
And the cop's like,
"So a page with a skull on it got stolen?"
They didn't have, uh, Brooklyn accents.
I'm adding that.
And he's like,
"Yeah!"
And then so the cop takes out his like, like, cop thing that he writes on -- his notepad -- and he starts drawing what it looks like on his notepad.
He's like, like just for their own records of what was stolen.
And I'm like,
"Okay."
"The artist who drew the skull is right there."
But the cop is drawing the skull on his cop pad.
It was very, like, weird.
And then, um, and then, uh, I, I start cycling through, and I have a wider shot of how all the pictures are arranged.
And then he goes over and he's like, he goes,
"Wait a minute."
He runs back to his table, and he just finds it underneath a different thing.

JAY:
Jesus.

MIKE:
"I moved it under here."

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
And then, and then all the police just go,
"Oh..."
"We could've been solving real crimes."
And then they left.

RICH:
Mike, you, you solved the mystery.

MIKE:
And then everyone was like,
"You, you're like a detective."

RICH:
Of the Evil Dead book.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're like,
"You..."
And so, uh, Tom Sullivan, he g-, he grabbed, like, a print of something and he signed it on the bottom.
He said,
"You rock -- Tom Sullivan."
And he gave it to me.

JAY:
He should've given you the actual page from the book.

MIKE:
He should have given...
Yes.

JAY:
You earned it.

MIKE:
Um...

RICH:
At least one of the lesser pages.
C'mon.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
C'mon.

MIKE:
So I still have that print.
The Tom Sullivan autograph print where he thanked me for solving the mystery of, of the missing Necronomicon page.

And I was like,
"Who would've stolen it?"
"There's nobody here."
Except for Joe Pilato and his, uh, and his, uh, his bathrobe.
And drinking out of a flask.

JAY:
Joe Pilato stole it.
He thought he could get a couple bucks for it.

MIKE:
Okay.
Now half the movie's over.

JAY:
That's true.

RICH:
No.
That was worth it.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
This always bothered me, the continuity of Ash's closeup to this wider shot.
Because his hair doesn't match at all.
If you look at the closeups, it's very, like, matted.
It's all wet, but it's matted down.
And then the wideshot, it's, uh, look at that.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
And then every time it cuts to the, uh, medium shot of him, it's completely different.

RICH:
It's fine.

JAY:
It's just something I...
I mean, it doesn't matter.
It's just something I always notice.
Yeah.
See, look.
It's totally different.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
Who, who is in charge of continuity on this film?

JAY:
Sam Raimi.

MIKE:
"Don't ya get it?"

JAY:
That's the weird thing about the continuity of these movies, is there is none, like, from movie to movie.
But the one thing that always stays consistent is the scars on Ash's face.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
In every movie, they're in the same spot.
That's the one thing they bothered to pay attention to.
It's very weird.

MIKE:
"That was just pillowtalk, baby."

JAY:
Yeah.
I remember Bruce Campbell felt like a, like a big movie star to me, because I was into this stuff at the time.
And then when I realized he wasn't a real movie star was when he became a, a regular supporting character on Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom.
He, like, he, like, owned the bookstore that she worked at, or something.
I barely remember now.
But I was like,
"Oh."
"That's Bruce Campbell."

RICH:
His string of failed TV shows didn't clue you in?

JAY:
I'm trying to think because he did, like, Briscoe County.
I think that was before he was on Ellen.

RICH:
Jack of All Trades.

JAY:
Jack of All Trades was right around that same era.
They kept trying.
They kept trying to make him a TV star, and it just never worked.

RICH:
It's strange that it never worked, because he is a funny motherfucker.

JAY:
Yeah.
He's, he's charismatic.
He's funny.
Around the time this movie was made, like, he looks like a leading man.
It just never happened.
I know Sam Raimi wanted him to play Dark Man, and the studio...
I guess the studio didn't demand they wanted someone more famous, because Liam Neeson wasn't...

RICH:
Well, that was probably for the best because Liam Neeson's great.

JAY:
He is good in that movie, but I, I, when it gets to the very end, and it's Bruce Campbell because he puts on a mask when he's leaving the, the building at the very end of the movie...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
I just always wish that it was him through the whole movie.
And I'm not sure why the studio didn't want him, because Liam Neeson wasn't a known actor, either.
Now, for some reason, Ash's evil doppleganger that's only existed for a few hours is, is leading this army.

MIKE:
Uh, why is that shot so distorted?
Is that just, uh, stylistic?

JAY:
They did some sort of, yeah.
I mean, it was a stylistic choice, but it looks like they had an anamorphic lens on and didn't squeeze it.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right.
It looks like, uh, incorrect aspect ratio.
Because all the, all the, the dolly-in shots to the tombstones are all kind of the same lens.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
They shot those things framed for anamorphic, and then they weren't filming in that...

JAY:
Yeah.
I don't know why.
It's just that one brief little bit.
I just want to know where he got his helmet from.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
Where'd all this shit come from?

MIKE:
It was some old warrior's helmet from a grave...

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And just dug it out of there.
Oh, I guess this is a R-rating.
Do we see boobs?

JAY:
Not really.
They're kind of covered.
I mean, they're clearly topless...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But you don't really see anything.
And it's completely pointless.
I don't know why they're there.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They have two, like, like, slave women for one second.

JAY:
That never show up for the rest of the movie.

MIKE:
Well, just find out who one of the producers on the film was, and you'll know why they're there.

JAY:
Was it Harvey Weinstein?

MIKE:
Little Harvey Weinstein.

RICH:
That's what got him in trouble.

MIKE:
That was his first picture.

JAY:
Oh, there's Ted Raimi on the left.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
One of his many roles.
Yeah.
Here's another Sam Raimi thing, where it's just this one brief little bit, where it's just whipping...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
To every character for their line.

MIKE:
Their panicking.

JAY:
They're panick-, yeah.
It's, it's great.

MIKE:
"I don't wanna die!"
Because then, then it's, yeah.
The panic has, has ended with this epic, uh, hero shot.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Run home and cry to mama."
I love how he talks to them, like, in modern day slang.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's just, he just doesn't care.

JAY:
Like in the beginning when he says like,
"Your shoelace is untied."

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

RICH:
I, I think he's too stupid to realize they won't know what he's talking about.

MIKE:
Maybe.

JAY:
Yeah.
It's part of his arrogance, like he's not even thinking about it.

MIKE:
Or, or he just doesn't care.
I don't know.
That's part of the charm, you know?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He doesn't start saying stuff about, like, honor and, you know, whatever, like some, someone from the Dark Ages might like understand.
"What are you gonna do, run home to your mama and cry?"
"...men from the future loudmouth braggarts?"
"No."
"Just me, baby."

JAY:
There's Ted Raimi again, as a different character.

MIKE:
"I'll stand by ya."
This was an impression I used to always do.
With, with the eyebrow raise.

JAY:
"You can count on my steel."

MIKE:
"You can count on my steel."
"Oh, sold up my arms with you."

JAY:
Now we're just ADR'ing the movie.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
"I'll bend my bow to your will, sir."

JAY:
I always like this piece of music for this montage here.
I used to use this in a lot of my old, uh, movies I made when I was a kid.

MIKE:
Like, this score is great.
It's, it's almost too good for this movie.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
The, the march of the dead theme...

JAY:
Well, it's the score you would have for an actual, like, swashbuckling adventure movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Now I think this is, this is another introduction of the army of the dead as a, as a good example of when the camera's moving around.
"I may be bad, but I feel good."

JAY:
This is, this is a pretty cringey line.

MIKE:
It is.
It is.

JAY:
I mean, I know the movie's got lots of corny stuff, but this line in particular always bugged me.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
And, and, and Embeth Davidtz's here, as like a, like a real actress.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Making her say this stupid crap.

MIKE:
"I may be bad..."
I think that's what I love so much about this movie.
It just, it just doesn't care...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
At all.

JAY:
And it, and it's, like, a relatively -- at least for Sam Raimi at the time -- big budget movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Like, you're making this medieval castle, you know, sword movie.
It's just complete nonsense.
There's his chemistry book, and there's a Fangoria magazine in this room, too.

RICH:
It has no artistic pretentions.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
No.

RICH:
It just wants to have fun.

JAY:
Well, that's, that's Sam Raimi...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
In a nutshell.
I think I mentioned that when we talked about the, maybe the Evil Dead remake.
But Sam Raimi kind of got his start with the Coen Brothers.
Like, one of 'em edited Evil Dead.
And they've worked together on-and-off over the years.
And there's this interview...
I have this book of filmmaker interviews, and this interviewer was asking him about that, like,
"How do you feel about the Coen Brothers?"
They're now, like, these critical darlings.
And they're doing these Academy Award-winning movies.
And you're making, like, schlock.
And he's like,
"I don't care."
"I'm just trying to please an audience."
Like, he, yeah.
He's the least pretentious filmmaker.
He doesn't think of himself as an artist.
He just, he just makes what he wants.

MIKE:
I like that little bit where he scooches the candle over.
And this, this training sequence...

JAY:
This is so stupid.

MIKE:
Is also, like, a joke.
Like...

JAY:
He teaches him that one move...

MIKE:
Yeah.
And then they use it later.

JAY:
And then they use it.

MIKE:
Like, grown men who are part of an army don't know "Hah! Hoo! Hee!"
And they're just...
It's like, it's like...
Again, it's like the training montage sequence.
They just slapped it together.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
This is, this is it.
This is all we're gonna do for it.

JAY:
The whole point of the movie is just to get to Bruce Campbell throwing around rubber skeletons.
That's all that matters.
And for some reason, he has an internal monologue here.
It's the only time in the entire film.

MIKE:
They forgot to shoot it.

JAY:
They had to make sure you knew what was happening.

MIKE:
They had to make sure, yeah, that the Necronomicon wanted it, and they had it behind a gate.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh.
Here, here's...

JAY:
This is all fun stuff.

MIKE:
This is all, yeah.

JAY:
This is, I think, Danny Elfman's music for this scene, but...
They're all playing these wind instruments even though none of 'em have lungs.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Some of 'em have beards?

RICH:
It's fine.

JAY:
It's great.

MIKE:
It's cute.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Well, that's why this is the Gremlins 2 of the Evil Dead franchise.

MIKE:
Yeah.
These shots, these shots are all lovely.

RICH:
Was Evil Dead 2 the first modern horror comedy?
Other than, obviously, Abbott and Costello Meet the Wolfman.

JAY:
Yeah.
Um, I mean, I guess there's, like, different levels of horror comedy.
Because, like, American Werewolf in London is a comedy, but that's, like, the horror in that is treated seriously.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
It just has, like, situational comedy.
I mean, Evil Dead is, like, completely goofy in its horror.
So, I don't know.
I'm not sure when Re-Animator came out.
It's right around the same era.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"I'll rip his balls off."

JAY:
Is that what he said?
"I'll rip his balls off"?

MIKE:
One, one of the skeletons in the background m-, mutters it.

JAY:
I always thought he said,
"I'll rip his bones out."
But the subtitle said "balls off".
Okay.

MIKE:
Do you think Peter Jackson watched this for tips?

JAY:
You know, I remember seeing The Two Towers in the theater and being reminded of Army of Darkness.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Obviously, a much different type of movie, but...
Oh, you can see that...

MIKE:
I know.
I know.

JAY:
Guy's eye in the mask.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
No, Jay.
That skeleton still has eyeballs.

JAY:
It's an homage to the Evil Dead II poster.

MIKE:
That man died wearing a skeleton mask, and he just got resurrected.

JAY:
Oh, okay.
It's coincidental.

MIKE:
Like, last...
He died, like, a week ago.
"My lord, we are positioned on both fronts."

JAY:
This, this guy on the right there is Bill Moseley...

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Um, who is in all the Rob Zombie movies.
And he was in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.

MIKE:
"Bring me forth into that castle."
Now here this, this little puppet...

JAY:
Oh, god.

MIKE:
Can barely stay on the horse.
Love it.
It's just ready to fall.
They're just watching.
"Oh, god."
"Don't fall."
"Don't fall."

JAY:
That's one of those thing where I'm picturing Sam Raimi behind the camera just laughing his head off.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Every, everybody knows and nobody cares because it's fun.

MIKE:
Now here I, I always used to wonder if they had varying lengths of wick, wicks on there, because...

JAY:
Because they all shoot at the same time?

MIKE:
They all, they all relatively go off at the same time.
But the guys who are positioned first who are lit first by torch boy...

JAY:
Yes.
"Torch boy."

MIKE:
Should have longer wicks because they're more likely to blow up sooner.

JAY:
Look at the tension, though.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This is great.
He's waiting for no reason.
I, I wonder if he gave it to...

JAY:
You see a lot of the, uh, the springboards when people blow up here.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Coming up.

MIKE:
When they start flying.

JAY:
You see, like, one try to run away, and you completely see the, the board that shoots him into the air.

MIKE:
Yeah.
"Ooh!"

JAY:
Like, you can see what's happening from back where he is.

MIKE:
Now here's where we start getting into stop-motion.

JAY:
Yeah.
How do you feel about this stop-motion?

RICH:
It's fine.

JAY:
I feel like there's not...
Like, if you're gonna do it, do more of it.
Elaborate on it more.
Because it doesn't really blend in with any of the live-action stuff.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So it's almost like it needs to embrace it more.
But I'm assuming that was a budgetary thing that they don't do more of it.

MIKE:
The entire army needed to be constantly just...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
All stop-motion skeletons.

JAY:
Like, I mean, it's obviously...
Oh, yeah.
There's all the springboards.
Um, it's obviously kind of a nod to Jason and the Argonauts.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Which is all stop-motion.
So, yeah.
Go all the way with it.

MIKE:
There's, there's a m-, or, you know, you can see the, clearly there are guys in costumes running.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And I always used to, they always used to bother me.
Um, but it's like, okay.
Some are in different states of decomposition.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Sure.
But it either should all just be an army of, like, zombiemen, or an army of skeletons.
One or the other.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's just that mixture.
And, like, then you cut to stuff like this.
A miniature with a, a little stop-motion skeletons.
Then the other ones, the ones that in close-up are just on tracks.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Just in front of the camera.

RICH:
I can't get too hung up on that for Army of Darkness.

MIKE:
I know.
I know.

JAY:
Yeah.
And it's obviously something you can shrug off in such a goofy movie.
But I always think about that.
Like, they tried to layer 'em in some of the wide shots where it's, like, the full skeletons are in the foreground...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Guys in, like, skeleton costumes are a little farther away...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And guys in just Halloween masks are way in the back of the shots.

MIKE:
Yeah.
If they were all, like, puppet skeletons like that from the waist up...
Because they have some swordfighting parts where they're fighting 'em.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like this kind of stuff.
Those g-, all those skeletons are great.
But the stop-motion...
It's like, yeah.
They needed full-bodied shots of them doing things.
But you could've, you could've cheated around it.
Here's a mixture.

JAY:
Yeah.
Here's where they tried, uh, to justify it by having kind of a combination of the two.

MIKE:
It's all right.
I like stuff like this.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
These shots look great.

JAY:
You just got a puppet right in the foreground.

RICH:
Well, it's sillier.
It's so obviously a puppet.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And that's so obviously a guy in a costume.

RICH:
Yeah.
But not as funny as the puppets.

MIKE:
No.
Here's the "hoo-hah".

JAY:
It pays off!
All the skeletons just stop so they can do it.

MIKE:
They knock the first row down.

JAY:
And that's it.

RICH:
That's it.

MIKE:
"Protect the book."
"God save us all."

JAY:
And here we get the famous car.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The Oldsmobile that's been in every Sam Raimi movie.
I remember when I saw...
Because I loved Sam Raimi so much. 
And then he did the first Spider-Man movie.
And I was like,
"That's great that he's doing a big movie."
And then seeing Uncle Ben's car was the Evil Dead car, I was like,
"That's, that's a wonderful little nod."
I'm glad that he's continued that.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And continued to work with the same people.
Like, the, the famous train scene in Spider-Man 2.
The hick from Evil Dead II is on that train.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
All the way up to his, his, uh, Wizard of Oz movie.
There's one shot in that where it's all the three ladies from the original Evil Dead are, are in it for one shot.

MIKE:
What Wizard of Oz movie?

JAY:
Oh.
You don't remember?
His famous, uh, hit film Oz the Great and Powerful?
I hope he makes another film so that's not his final theatrical movie.

RICH:
The James Franco one?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He hasn't made a movie since that?

JAY:
No.
That James Franco movie, that's a remake of this movie.
We talk about that in our discussion for it.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
It's, like, the same story, basically.

MIKE:
I have no memory of it.

JAY:
That's completely fine.
There's a couple fun Sam Raimi moments in it, but it's pretty forgettable.
He did direct the pilot for Ash vs Evil Dead, which was great.
That had some classic Sam Raimi stuff in it.

RICH:
Is he doing an episode of season 2, or no?

JAY:
I think he just did that pilot episode.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

MIKE:
How many seasons did that show go?

JAY:
Three.

MIKE:
And it's done now?

JAY:
It's done now.

MIKE:
It's worth a watch.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
I think so.

MIKE:
Okay.
I'll put it on the list.

JAY:
Bruce Campbell's obviously too old to do some of the physical comedy stuff, but is still the same presona.

RICH:
There's still some of the physical comedy stuff.

JAY:
A little bit of it.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
He, he can't do, like, the Evil Dead II flipping himself over...

RICH:
No.

JAY:
I remember I saw he directed a movie called The Man with the Screaming Brain, which apparently...
Bruce Campbell directed it, and he had been trying to get it made for...
Oh, wait.
We're gonna miss the, the Kurlan naiskos...

MIKE:
People throw skel-, skeletons at him.

JAY:
They don't...
They're not articulated.

MIKE:
Nope.

JAY:
It's someone off-camera just throwing a skeleton at him.

RICH:
That makes it funnier.

JAY:
I know.
It's great.
But that Man with the Screaming Brain movie that Bruce Campbell directed and he stars in it, and he tries to do some of the physical stuff.
But he's just a little too old, and it's a little awkward, and it was kind of depressing.
So I'm glad they didn't have him try and have him do too much of that in the new show, and it focuses more on his, uh, personality and his kind of cocky...

MIKE:
I remember seeing him on a panel at a convention, and he was, the people,
"When are you gonna do..."
Every other question was,
"When are you gonna..."

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
"Do more Evil Dead movies?"

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And I don't know if it was just his canned response, but he's just like,
"I'm too old."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"It's hard for me to get up in the morning."
He's just, like, making all of these excuses, um, where it just seemed like he didn't want to.
And then...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That show came out, and I remember thinking,
"Oh..."

JAY:
I think he, I think at the time...

MIKE:
"Money talks."

JAY:
Oh, sure.
I mean, I think he probably thought he was done with it at that point...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because he was getting older, but then they worked that into the show, so it's fine.

The beginning of the show is him strapping himself into a girdle to go out and pick up chicks.
Him being old is a running gag.

MIKE:
Does he still workat S-Mart?

JAY:
It's not called S-Mart because there was some sort of rights issues thing where they couldn't...

RICH:
But, basically, yes.

JAY:
Reference Army of Darkness.

MIKE:
Okay.
Okay.

JAY:
It's basically that.

MIKE:
What, what, what, uh, network, what app do I have to get to watch this?

RICH:
Starz.

MIKE:
Starz?
Okay.

JAY:
You can just borrow my Blu-rays.
How about that?

MIKE:
Oh.
Okay.
Then they don't make any money off me.

JAY:
The show's done now.
It doesn't matter...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
If you support it or not.

MIKE:
I'm sure I could buy it on Amazon, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
I still gotta get caught up.
I haven't seen season three yet.

JAY:
You know, season three, like, I don't think it was, it wasn't intended to be the final season.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
I think they were kind of unsure if it was gonna come back or not.
So I think some people are upset at how the season ends.
I think for the Evil Dead franchise, it ends perfectly.
I, I think it ends exactly like an Evil Dead, uh, movie or TV show should end.

MIKE:
Is that...
This is a stupid question.
Is that Bruce Campbell's voice as the doppleganger, like, bad guy?

JAY:
It is until he comes back as just a skeleton, and then it's Sam Raimi for some reason.

MIKE:
Oh.
Okay.
But that's not Bruce Campbell in the costume?

JAY:
It is.

MIKE:
It is.
Oh.
Okay.

RICH:
Oh.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
I'm actually shocked by that.

JAY:
No.
It's him.

MIKE:
Then they don't have to ADR every single line of dialogue.
But I didn't know if they bothered, because it sounds like Bruce Campbell.
I was listening to it and I'm like...

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's him.
I mean, obviously, the shots when they're together and they're swordfighting, it's a double.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
For most of it, yeah.
It was him.

MIKE:
"You found me beautiful once."
"Honey, you got real ugly."

JAY:
That's another thing they just kind of brush over, is he just stabbed her through the stomach and threw her off the top of the castle, and at the end of the movie she just turns normal again and is alive.

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
He killed the evil spirit within her.

JAY:
But he stabbed her through the stomach and threw her off the top of the castle.

MIKE:
Jay, there are no, no rules in the Evil Dead movie.

JAY:
There kind of are.

MIKE:
I guess once, once, uh, this guy...
What's the official character's name of this?

JAY:
Of the evil version of him?

RICH:
I just call him Bad Ash.

MIKE:
"Bad Ash"?

JAY:
Yeah.
"Evil Ash".
I don't think he has a name, really.

MIKE:
Um, uh, once he dies, everybody, all the skeletons just flee?

JAY:
Yeah.
It's a little bit different in the, the international cut, like, where different things happen during this fight.
It's kind of reorganized a bit.
Um, in this version, the minute he dies, everybody runs away.
But I don't believe that's how it happens in the in-, international one.
I think they start to flee when Eric the Red and his people show up.

MIKE:
Mm.
Oh, really?

JAY:
It's, it's sort of been, yeah, reorganized and truncated for this one.
I think that's when they flee.
I could be wrong.
But it's not just,
"Our leader is dead, so let's all run away."

MIKE:
Right.

RICH:
All said and done, pretty good sword fight.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
As goofy as this movie is, I always thought this was a, a decent little action scene.
Here you have all the music drop out.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Sam Raimi's always good, been good about that.
Like, when to use music...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And when not to have any music.
I remember in the VHS version, the guy that was fighting on the right-hand side of the screen, he's mostly cropped out because it was 4:3.
But you see him for, like, just a second, and so I thought it was a crew member that just got into the shot.
Here's Ted Raimi again.
Now with an eyepatch.
Yeah.
Now for some reason, he's just a complete skeleton, and it's voiced by Sam Raimi.
I don't know why his voice changed.

MIKE:
His vocal cords got burnt out.

RICH:
Because, because Sam Raimi is, is Bruce Campbell's ultimate antagonist.

JAY:
That's true.
That's very true.

MIKE:
The stop-motion and the live-action shots just blend together so perfectly.

JAY:
It's seamless.

MIKE:
It's, it is seamless.

JAY:
I do like that the skeleton still has eyeballs, though.
I don't know if that's an intentional nod to the Evil Dead II poster, but...

MIKE:
It gives it some life and some character.

JAY:
Yeah.
This is kind of stupid, but whatever.

MIKE:
Slot machine eyes.
Ehh...
Uh-oh.
Gotta put 'em on the bag of TNT.
Or, er, uh, gunpowder.
Oh.
I guess the Necronomicon blows up, so that, that kills all the evil...

JAY:
No.
He, he cuts his hand off and takes it back.

MIKE:
Oh.
That's right.

JAY:
He needs it so he can get back to his time.

MIKE:
Yes.
"Buckle up, bonehead."
It's not the proper sword type for that era, I don't think.

JAY:
My immersion is ruined.

RICH:
The movie is ruined.

MIKE:
It looks like a machete or something.
Although they never really establish where they are.
I don't know.

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, they, they have Arthur.
But it's not, like, the King Arthur.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's just named Arthur.
Yeah.
She just, now she's just...
Okay.

MIKE:
Because the evil has been defeated, Jay.

JAY:
Did that repair all of her injuries?

MIKE:
Just deal with it.

RICH:
It, it makes it funnier when he abandons her so he can go to work at S-Mart.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's true.
Why bring her back at all if he's just gonna leave her in the next scene?
They could've played that up as a joke.
And they don't really.
Because they have kind of a little romantic moment when he leaves.

MIKE:
They have a goodbye.

JAY:
They have, like, a, yeah.
It's, like, a sweet goodbye.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
There, there's a way to do that as a joke where he's just like,
"See ya."
They don't really do that.

MIKE:
No.
He, uh, he, he's a jerk and he's selfish, but he knows when to write decisions.
Because he, he...

JAY:
When he's forced to because he has no other options.

MIKE:
Um...
Well, the, they all make him feel bad, you know, for abandoning them, and then he chooses to help them fight the army instead of leaving, right?

JAY:
Sure, sure.
You mean, when he becomes less interesting?

MIKE:
Right.

RICH:
Well, I know that Bruce Campbell said in the commentary track for this that he wanted his character to be hiding somewhere for the entire last act.

MIKE:
That would've been good.

JAY:
I guess that's kind of similar to, like, uh, Little Trouble in Little China where...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Half of the climax of the movie, uh, Kurt Russell is passed out.
Now here, we have some ADR to set up the re-shot ending.
I'm assuming you've both seen the...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
The, the original intended ending.

RICH:
Which do you prefer?
Which is the best ending?

JAY:
Um...
The theat-, the U.S. theatrical cut ending is more entertaining.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
The original ending is appropriate for Ash as a character.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
I like both of them.
I don't know if I could pick.
Although, if you want to go with, like, canon, this is the canon ending because it leads into Ash vs Evil Dead.

RICH:
Isn't the, the original ending just too much of a rehash of Evil Dead II's ending, though?
It's basically the same joke.

JAY:
Uh...

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Kind of.
Except, I mean, in that, he's, you know, surrounded by people that are now worshipping him.

RICH:
Right.

JAY:
In, in, in the post-apocalypse he's just completely alone because he fucked up.
He slept too long.

MIKE:
Does it say how long he slept for?

JAY:
He slept for...
Each drop that he has to take is, like, 100 years or something.

MIKE:
That's right, yeah.

JAY:
And he takes one too many, so he wakes up 100 years later than he's supposed to.

MIKE:
A post-apocalyptic Ash vs Evil Dead would've been a cool movie.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's Ted Raimi again.

RICH:
But then we don't get the b-, one of the best lines in the movie.

JAY:
That's true.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I, I think I completely agree with your sentiment, Jay.

JAY:
I like both of them...

MIKE:
Both of them work in two different ways.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is a lot of fun, though.
This final fight scene in the, uh, in the S-Mart.
What video game character just ripped off all of his lines?

RICH:
Oh, Duke Nukem.

JAY:
Is that Duke Nukem?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Okay.
How did they get away with that?
Just blatantly stealing.

RICH:
Yeah.
Can you copyright lines?
Can you copyright "Hail to the king, baby"?

JAY:
I don't know.
I mean, if there's multiple lines that all come from the same source, it feels like you should have a case, but...

RICH:
You can't, you can't copyright "groovy".

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's true.
This is, this a great Evil Dead creature.
This is, like, a classic Evil Dead hag.
"I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the store."
This is another moment where does, like, an action thing that doesn't make any sense, where he throws the gun up into the air for no reason.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Just, just so he can catch it again because it looks cool.

MIKE:
He threw it.

JAY:
Jumps on the cart.

MIKE:
He throws it ahead of himself.
It's like, uh...

JAY:
I do wish this went on longer.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
This is a fun action scene, but then he just kind of shoots it and it falls over.

RICH:
Ehh...for, for what they're doing, it's great.

MIKE:
It goes on for just the right amount.

JAY:
I, I, I...

RICH:
It's just the end.

JAY:
Sure, sure.

MIKE:
Doesn't she bounce on a trampoline at some point?

JAY:
Uh, I think she already did.
Oh.
Right there, yeah.

MIKE:
Boing!

JAY:
Yeah.
This is amost like,
"Oh, you want us to re-shoot the ending to make it happier?"
"Well, we're gonna do this."
And it's just, like, ridiculous.

MIKE:
And there he's wearing his Ash costume.

JAY:
Yeah.
I don't know why that became his, like, official outfit.
It's a diff-...
It's not always the same shirt, but it's always, like, a blue shirt...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And brown pants.

MIKE:
There, it's quite the complicated blue shirt.
There's always buttons all over it.

JAY:
Yeah.
I don't know what that is.

RICH:
How would you recognize him if he wasn't a blue shirt and brown pants?

JAY:
Oh.
Because he's Bruce Campbell?
I also loved that Sam Raimi wrote this with his brother who's not a professional screenwriter.
He's, like, a doctor or something.
And he just wrote it with him, because why not?

MIKE:
Who is not Ted Raimi.

JAY:
Not Ted Raimi.

MIKE:
How many br-, how many Raimi's are there, Jay?

JAY:
I think there's just the three.

MIKE:
Three Raimi's.
Three times the fun.

JAY:
What?

MIKE:
Except for the doctor.
What is, what is Ted Raimi do?
Is he an actor?

JAY:
He's an actor, yeah.
He's in all sorts of stuff.
He was a regular at Xena: Warrior Princess.
Because that was, Sam Raimi produced that show.

RICH:
Oh.
That was 30 years ago.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
He, he shows up on Ash vs Evil Dead.

MIKE:
He's still working, bitch.

JAY:
I'm just thinking of, like, other Sam Raimi-related stuff.

RICH:
Right.

JAY:
No.
He's in all sorts of, like, low-budget horror things and random appearances in things.

RICH:
I don't think I've ever seen him in something that wasn't, like, uh, a Sam Raimi movie or TV show.

JAY:
Um, he's doing a number of things.
He's in a movie from the 90's called Skinner, where he plays, like, a serial killer.
He's actually pretty good in it.
This is edited by Bob Murawski, who went on to do Sam Raimi's other, like, big movies.
And was also responsible for restoring that Orson Welles movie that's on Netflix now.
So that was E-...
I almost said Evil Dead II.
Why didn't we talk about Evil Dead II?

RICH:
We did?

JAY:
I mean, why didn't we do the commentary for that one?

RICH:
I don't know.
We should

MIKE:
We could.
But we got all the time in the world.

RICH:
That's one of th-, one of those ones that I'd just be watching the movie.
"Oh, this is a great scene."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Probably even moreso than this one because there's long stretches where it's just kind of Bruce Campbell hanging out in the cabin.

MIKE:
Yeah.
This one at least has, like, more set pieces and scenes...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Locations, and...

JAY:
And it's 80 minutes long.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's one thing I noticed.
I never really paid attention to, like, movie lengths when I was a kid.
I just kind of watched this movie over and over.
But rewatching it now, like, it moves so fast.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
80 minutes.
It's like it's over before it starts.

RICH:
It's like a third of the length of a modern movie.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's like Return of the Jedi.
The first chunk is all in Jabba's Palace.
And it's, like, like, most of the movie.

RICH:
Uh-huh.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then they're on Endor for a little bit, and the rest is the battle.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's like,
"Oh, that's kind of what this is like."
There's that big scene in the beginning.
It's, like, 20 minutes of the movie.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Then, ehh, crap in the...

RICH:
Crap in the middle.

JAY:
The little Ashes.

RICH:
There's a windmill.

JAY:
"There's a windmill."

MIKE:
"There's windmill crap, and the little Ash, and now we're into the big battle, and that's the rest of the movie."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Skywalker Sound.

RICH:
Did they do the Kurlan naiskos?

JAY:
I'd be curious, the origin of that sound effect.
Like, you can pinpoint the origin of the Wilhelm Scream...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That's why it's called the Wilhelm Scream because of what it's originally from.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
But what was the first thing to use that pottery break sound effect?
Somebody out there, do some research and find this out for us.

MIKE:
I jsut, I just picture some guy dropping his grandmother's vase somewhere.

JAY:
Some Foley studio.

MIKE:
1948.
"Pssht!"
"Hey, that sounded great, Bill."

RICH:
"Drop another one."
"That didn't sound as good."
"Keep the first one."

MIKE:
It's a weird quality to it...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Where it has...

JAY:
Well, it's, yeah.
It's very distinct.

MIKE:
Very distinct, yes.

JAY:
The best use of it is, of course, in Wet Hot American Summer.
They use that same sound effect, like, 20 times.
Tom Sullivan.

MIKE:
There's my buddy, Tom Sullivan.
I just told the most embarrassing event of his life.
"I thought everybody forgot about that."

JAY:
"There was nobody at that convention."
"I thought no one would ever know."
That's okay.
You've horribly embarrassed Joe Pilato from that event, too.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So this...

RICH:
So many good times.
You need to make a movie about that, that experience.

MIKE:
I do.
I do.

JAY:
The convention that had no, uh, attendants whatsoever.

MIKE:
The, the, one of the most surreal moments was, uh, was it Doug, Doug Bradley?
Brady?

JAY:
Doug, Doug Bradley is Pinhead, yeah.

MIKE:
Pinhead, yes.
Where Pinhead was screaming at the guy who ran the convention outside.
Outside the...

JAY:
Because no one was there?

MIKE:
Because no one was there.
"You're a stupid fuckhead."
Is he, is he British?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.
He was screaming at him.
And I was like,
"Oh, my god."
"That's Pinhead."
I had a dr-...

RICH:
He is a real monster.

MIKE:
I had a drink at the bar next to Pinhead.
And then I had a cheeseburger with, uh, The Hills Have Eyes guy.

JAY:
Michael Berryman.

MIKE:
Michael Berryman, yeah.
And then -- I may have mentioned this before -- I went around and got, I was gonna get all the signatures on my Dawn of the Dead VHS tape, which I think we used as a prop in something.
We showed it.

JAY:
It's somewhere, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, no.
It's a DVD.
Not VHS.
It's a DVD.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
I think we used it when we talked about Dawn of the Dead.

MIKE:
Yes.
And, uh, I got Ken Foree to sign it, and, uh...

RICH:
Is that the one they were selling at a pawn shop and they had it, like, marked as, like, $100, which is a joke.

MIKE:
That was my VHS, yes.

RICH:
That was your VHS copy of Dawn of the Dead.

MIKE:
Yes.
I found it at a pawn shop and it said "Non-collector's edition - $100".
And I said,
"This is a great movie."
"I wanna, you know..."

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I only had it on, like, a thing I taped off, like, TV or something, and I was like, I'm like,
"Is this really $100?"
And he's like,
"No."
"Five bucks."
"All right."
But I got my Dawn of the Dead DVD insert signed by Ken Foree.
And even though there was no one there, Ken Foree didn't even look at me.
I, I gave him $25 to, like, his handler or his son or something, and he signed it and he was having a conversation with something and he signed it and he didn't even look at me.
I was like,
"Oh."
And then I went and I got Gaylen Ross's signature.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
And, uh, the guy who played Peter...
No.
Peter is, um, uh, Ken Foree.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, who's the other guy?

RICH:
Hot Shots.

JAY:
Fly Boy?

RICH:
Um, Fly Boy, yeah.

MIKE:
Not Fly Boy.
Not Fly Boy.
The other guy.
The other SWAT guy.

JAY:
Oh, uh, Scott something is his real name.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yes.
I, I got his signature, and they were all $25 each.
And then I just, I just, I was gonna get the helicopter pilot, and then I just said,
"What am I doing?"
"Like, why am I spending my money on this?"
And so I stopped.
So I have an autographed DVD with three out of four main characters.

JAY:
Doesn't that bother you now, though, that it's not complete?

MIKE:
It, it really doesn't.
I'm okay with it.

JAY:
That's fair.

MIKE:
I just, I had a, like a little moment where I was like,
"What am I doing?"
Um, someday I'll make a movie about that con-, that horror convention.

JAY:
That one convention, yeah.
Sam Raimi's starting to do conventions now.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing for him, but...

MIKE:
You can go up and talk to Sam Raimi.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Ask him about the belt on the chain.

JAY:
That's all I want to know about.

MIKE:
Is that a, like, an Indiana Jones joke, or were you, would you think it would be more exciting, or wh-, wh-, what?
What?

JAY:
That's when you get that look where he just stares at you.
"What are you talking about?"

MIKE:
And, and then security comes.
"Tell us about the belt on the chain!"
And then you start getting dragged away.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Cops come drag you to the loony bin.
"Get that man away from me."

JAY:
Well, thank you for joining us to watch Army of Darkness.
