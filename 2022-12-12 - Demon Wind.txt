MIKE:
So, guys.
What are we watching today?

JAY:
I don't know.
It's just a black screen right now.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
But I'm, I'm very, uh, very anxious.

MIKE:
What does it say, Rich?

RICH:
It says "Demon Wind".

JAY:
Demon Wind?

RICH:
Oh.
I can hear wind.
That's the demon wind.

MIKE:
Are you sure it's not an unrelated wind?
Oh, my goodness gracious.

JAY:
Ugh.
My grandfather went the exact same way.

MIKE:
Somebody got burnt on a cross in 1931.

JAY:
It was a lot more common back then, right?

MIKE:
Uh, I don't know.

JAY:
It's, really, it's like the equivalent of a lawn flamingo in 1931.
It's why the Homeowner's Association started.
To stop all those lawn crucifixions.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
"I thought I told you before."
"Keep Fluffy in her cage at night."

JAY:
This is the worst family barbecue ever.

MIKE:
I, I figured out the, the family lineage by the way, gentlemen.
I've seen this film...

JAY:
Of this movie we haven't watched?

MIKE:
I, I've seen the film before, uh, 14 different times.

JAY:
Oh, my god.
You've seen Demon Wind 14 times.

MIKE:
Yes.
And you guys...

RICH:
So it has to be really good then?

MIKE:
Well, no...

JAY:
I can't wait.

MIKE:
I, I've watched it 14 times so I could figure out what the fuck is going on.

JAY:
I'm sorry.
What was that?
I wasn't listening.

MIKE:
Having a fireplace made out of cardboard and, and paper doesn't seem like the best idea.
"Jesus was always my favorite family member."

JAY:
So what relation is Jesus?

MIKE:
That's their Uncle Jesus.

JAY:
Great Uncle Jesus?

MIKE:
Jesus, ironically, all of his photos are in color.
But all the people born in 1931, all their photos are in black and white.
I don't know how they achieved this technological achi-, marvel.
"Would it hurt you to smile, grandma?"
"You're in Demon Wind."
"Your career is going places."
"Uncle Jesus, the college years."
Oh.
It's my favorite song.
Washed in the blood of the lamb by Styx.

RICH:
That's what you got?

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Th-, they like their candles.
I guess, uh, their wicker baskets.

JAY:
They love the Jesus.

MIKE:
The Jesus protects the house when, except for the fact that it, he doesn't protect the house.
Candles.
Glass jars.
Religious photos.
Wicker baskets.
Oh.
Now I know where my thrift store got all of its merchandise.

RICH:
That's what you got?

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
No one showed up.
The one guy that did show up, they burned down a cross.

JAY:
Help me, Jesus.
I'm watching Demon Wind.

MIKE:
It's kind of funny.
They, they've k-, they have all this religious pic-, all these religious pictures, you know?
All, they have all these pictures of Jesus, but they never once, like, mention Jesus in any of their spells.
It's not religious, you know, towards the end, Jay.
We've seen it...

JAY:
Oh.
You've, you've seen this movie before?

MIKE:
I've seen this movie before Rich and Jay.

JAY:
So you've paid to see it again in a theater, huh?

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
That's...

RICH:
Well, then it's gotta be good, right?

JAY:
I, I'm assuming so, yeah.
We'll find out.

MIKE:
"Rosebud."

JAY:
"Demon Wind."

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
Out of all that religious shit, they, they didn't even have a good cross to use?
They had to make it out of, like, cardboard?

JAY:
Well, they spent all their money on the Jesus pictures.

MIKE:
Oh.
Those boards are nailed to the door.
That literally does nothing.
They, you know what I mean?
Do, do you know what I'm saying, Rich?

RICH:
I know what you're saying.

MIKE:
They're just nailed to the door.
They're not, they're not keeping the, the...
Oh.
I guess a little bit goes on the frame, but...

JAY:
A couple of them are on the frame.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I guess they...
Okay.
I take it back.

RICH:
I mean, it would keep you from pulling the door out.

MIKE:
Sure.
But, you know what?
In my personal experience, if a demon wants to get in your house, nothing's gonna stop it, you know?

RICH:
Did Zak Bagans tell you that?

MIKE:
He did.
Yeah.
"You always told me you liked my cooking."
He's just, uh, having a diabetic reaction to her Christmas cookies.
This is what happens when Rich eats fish.
"I told you I was allergic to your green bean casserole."

RICH:
He just went to the gym with John Travolta.

MIKE:
I don't understand that joke at all, but...

JAY:
I think I do, and I don't like it.

MIKE:
Does John Travolta have diseases?
I don't understand your joke, Rich.

JAY:
I think it was a semen joke.

MIKE:
Oh!
Oh!
Like, thatk's what was coming out of his mouth?
All curdled and disgusting and filled with blood?

JAY:
Well, that's what Hollywood does to you.
Are you sure we're not watching David Lynch's Dune?
This is the baron, right?

MIKE:
"Oh, here."
"Drink this snow globe."
"It's got Benadryl..."

JAY:
"Drink this snow globe."

MIKE:
"It's got, it's got Benadryl in it."
This, now this snow globe is magic, Rich.
For no reason at all.
As she breaks the snow globe.

JAY:
It's a Jesus snow globe.

MIKE:
The curse is broken, or something.
I guess it's filled with gasoline.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Although this is only their second-worst Thanksgiving ever.

RICH:
I don't know.
I'm, I'm not liking this gritty Citizen Kane remake.

JAY:
Is that the end of the movie?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
'Ladies and gentlemen, Ireland's most advanced expressway."
Not bad.
Pretty good?

JAY:
"Not bad."

MIKE:
As soon as we meet our hero, Cory, I'll explain to you the lineage...
Or you guys just ask me.
I mean, this is the premise.
Uh, he's driving, uh, he's taking his girlfriend...
What the hell's her name?
Diane or something?
I don't know.
Lily Rabe.

JAY:
Bea Arthur?

MIKE:
He's driving her...
Oh.
Here's a flashback.
He's driving her to visit, to find her grandparents's, uh, farm, farmhouse.
And now this is Cory's dad.
He hasn't seen his dad his whole life, and he decides to look him up and visit him.
And then the very next day after being visited by his son, Cory, his dad kills himself.

JAY:
So, pretty standard Christmas?

MIKE:
I mean...

JAY:
Maybe he killed himself...

MIKE:
Can you blame him?

JAY:
Because he lived in a cardboard apartment building.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right.
Or Cory told  him he was gonna pursue acting.
"I"m in this new film called Demon Wind."

JAY:
"Fuck this!"
Slit.

RICH:
"I can't live with the shame."

MIKE:
"I can't live with the shame of your career."
Uh, but he hasn't told his girlfriend about that his father killed himself.
All he told her is,
"Listen."
"We, we gotta go find my grandparents's farm."
"And, and I'm gonna invite twelve of my whitest friends to come along so they can be killed off one-by-one by demons."

JAY:
I mean, it sounds like a fun group activity.

RICH:
I think a couple more of them could've rode within that car.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Saved on gas?

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
No room.
The backseat was taken up with all of his emotional baggage.

MIKE:
"Parents."
"It's 10 am."
"Do you know where your neglected redheaded stepchild is?"
Oh, my god.
You're not gonna toiuch the car with that stick.
It's just not gonna happen.
Also, they invented soap.
That little girl.
Get in the bathtub.
Unless you're a ghost.
Do you think she's a ghost?

JAY:
I don't know.
There, there's no indication that she is or isn't.

MIKE:
She looks like she could be inbred, though.

JAY:
Mike, that's very rude.

MIKE:
That's why I thought this was Ireland.
There's some, some scummy, dirty Irish child in the shop.
You know what I mean?
Unwashed Irish is just in their shot.

JAY:
Do you just assume that they don't take baths in Ireland?

MIKE:
I don't know.
I don't know much about Ireland.
Isn't driving fun?
Don't you love watching people drive somewhere, Rich, in a film?

RICH:
It's kind of...
I mean, it kind of works in Cannonball Run.

JAY:
Would you say Demon Wind is the Cannonball Run of horror films?

RICH:
I think that's a very accurate statement, yes.

MIKE:
It kind of sounded like you said Cannibal Run.

JAY:
I did the first time.

MIKE:
No, Rich.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
So, we're gonna, we're gonna workshop that later, okay?

RICH:
Can-, Cannibal Run?

JAY:
Cannibal Run's a good name for a horror film.

MIKE:
But first, we gotta talk about this gas station.
And this very common dream that I've had.
I don't know about you guys.

RICH:
It's being naked at a gas station you've never been to before?

MIKE:
Right.
While holding a...
What is he holding?

JAY:
I think he's there for a lube job.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
You're naked at a gas station and your bloody mother comes out and laughs at you.
I've had this dream before.
Oh.
That's not his mother.
That's his grandmother.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Would you like me to talk about the lineage yet?

RICH:
Why don't you, why don't you please tell me about the lineage?

MIKE:
Well, they're about to go inside the gas station, though.
And that's some of the best scenes in the film.
Because we get to see the paper mache gas station.

RICH:
All right.
We just have the naked dream.
That's pretty exciting.

MIKE:
I'll wait till the next driving scene, okay?
To talk about the lineage.
Because I still don't understand it.

RICH:
Wait.
There's more than one driving scene?

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
There's lots of driving and walking and waiting.

RICH:
But why?

MIKE:
That was the original title of the film.
"This road is really doing a number on my hemorrhoids."
Oh.
See.
They spot the gas station from the top of the hill, then they take the car three miles an hour to the gas station so that we can wait even longer for them to get there.
This is where he chose to put his gas station?

RICH:
This does seem like a terrible location.

MIKE:
"Oh, thank god."
"I haven't had a customer since 1952."

JAY:
There's not even, like, a gravel parking lot.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
It's just in the middle of a field.

MIKE:
Because it's fake.
It's a fake gas station, Jay.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
There's literally no infrastructure around to, where they could fill the gas tanks up under the ground or anything.

RICH:
But it's, it's a spooky supernatural gas station, Mike.
It shouldn't be there!

MIKE:
Maybe if that, if it's a ghost gas station, perhaps.
But I think they just didn't want to film at a real gas station.
You know, so they just made one.
The first time I saw this film, I thought it was gonna blow up, you know?
It's like when they have an old car in the middle of a field.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
You know it's coming.

RICH:
This film was, this film was destined to flop.

MIKE:
What?

RICH:
There's no way this was gonna blow up.

MIKE:
No.
No.
The gas station, not the film.
"There's no such place as a barber shop, either."
"So don't go looking for that."
Do you think these gas pumps actually work?

JAY:
Do you think these actors actually work?

MIKE:
Not anymore.
Not after Demon Wind came out.
If you had a dream where you were naked, and your mother was bloodied with her throat ripped open, would you stop at this gas station?
I probably wouldn't.
I'd skip it.

JAY:
I mean, they gotta window made out of whitie duct tape.

MIKE:
It looks like Pee-Wee's Playhouse.
It's like that junky-looking.

JAY:
And, Rich, this is a gas station, not a high school play set.
I guess this movie takes place in a world where all the buildings are constructed from paper mache.

MIKE:
Jay, it's plywood.
Okay?

JAY:
Well, the, the window on that door is definitely made of white duct tape.

MIKE:
It's like a, it's like, like plastic tarp.
And that's, like, cardboard.
"Oh."
"I picked the wrong boyfriend."
"Now, what should I order?"
"Hey, lady."
"The bathroom's out back."

RICH:
No.
He was the one that was naked in the dream.

JAY:
Oh.
She's gonna release some demon wind.

MIKE:
Oh, no.
Uh...

JAY:
This is very common behavior.
It's very realistic.

RICH:
This is what the "humans" do.

JAY:
Was this movie made by the demon wind?

RICH:
Maybe they're on their "honeymoon"?

MIKE:
I'm afraid the character made a joke about that already.
He says something about a moon.
I think it's a quote from something.
"Ooh!"
"I'll take the goats milk!"
This lady looks like she's from 1940 or '30.
Is she a ghost?

RICH:
I think she's a ghost.

MIKE:
You think?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or a demon?
A demon disguised as a person?

RICH:
I think she's a demon ghost from the 1950's, from grandma's time.

MIKE:
Do you think they're turning a profit with those $0.50 fish burgers?

RICH:
Well, I mean, nobody drives by there for gas, so they gotta supplement their income somehow.

MIKE:
Do you think the gas pumps even work?

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
They're just there for show?
Like a decoration?

RICH:
To entice you to come in and get a sandwich.

MIKE:
Right.
A fish burger.

JAY:
To get a fish burger.

MIKE:
Or barbecue.

JAY:
A barbecued fish burger?

MIKE:
Sure, why not?

RICH:
"Hey, I need some gas."
"Our gas pumps don't work, but come on, have a fish burger while you're here."

MIKE:
"And some goats milk."
I, I, I still don't understand why Dell kisses her on the mouth.

JAY:
Mike, they're a very close group of friends.

MIKE:
That's a little, it's a little, uh, you know, that's, like, his best buddy's girlfriend, and he just kisses her on the fucking mouth.

RICH:
He's the asshole.
His character is the asshole.

MIKE:
Well, then he starts smooching her.
And his line is,
"That's why I keep her around."
He says it three times.
I don't know.

RICH:
He's the asshole.

MIKE:
He, Dell just spreads around herpes amongst everybody.
Now, Cory has invited, uh, eleven of his white friends to go with him to his haunted grandparents's cabin for no reason at all.
Perhaps for them to get killed off.
I don't know.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or turned into demons.

JAY:
They're there for emotional support.
Who knows what they're gonna find at this abandoned cabin that somebody died at 60 years earlier.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I don't really...

JAY:
You, you need 25 of your, your, uh, 40-year old high school friends.

RICH:
Was that, was that...

MIKE:
"Thanks for coming with me on this very, very vague mission, um..."
"I'll tell you all about it when we get to the, the demonically-possessed burnt down cabin."
"Then I'll tell you all about why you're here."
"I'm in."
"Sign me up, Cory."
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

JAY:
Uh, I mean, the important part is that, uh, he, he invited his entire high school class to come hang out at the cabin with him, for some reason.

MIKE:
Right.
His 90's friends.

JAY:
"I'll tell you all about my family's depressing history over a couple of fish burgers."

MIKE:
Over some cokes and a Milwaukee's Best.
"No, we don't drink that filth."

JAY:
Has there ever been a more ironically titled beer?

MIKE:
No.
I suppose not.

JAY:
"Oh, we're just down here talking about your dick."

MIKE:
So I guess...
Oh.
She date-, she must've dated him.
The blonde who's date-, who's Cor-, who's Cory's girlfriend?
Because they were talking about Dell's penis size.
Oh, her name's Elaine, by the way.

RICH:
The girlfriend?

MIKE:
Her.
Elaine.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, I, and her and, uh, I think her name's, uh, um, oh, Barbara, or fucking something like that?
Betsy?
I wrote it down.
Hold on.
Give me a minute.
I gotta go through my notes.

JAY:
I"ll give you several minutes.

MIKE:
Uh...
She's the only who showed up for the cast and crew interviews on the Blu-ray.

JAY:
Oh, yeah?

MIKE:
Um...

RICH:
Everyone else killed themselves.

MIKE:
Ah, geez.

JAY:
So the sequel to this movie is gonna be meta, and it's gonna be the filmmakers traveling to this cabin to find out why the actors killed themselves?

RICH:
"My grandpa made Demon Wind here 30 years ago."

MIKE:
That would be difficult.

JAY:
"The next day, he killed himself."

MIKE:
"The next day..."
All the demons, the undead demons are people that attended the premier.
"There was a fire at the premier of Demon Wind."
I keep hoping something different happens every time I watch the movie.
Like it'll change, you know?

JAY:
Like Clue?

MIKE:
Like Clue, yeah.

JAY:
When that was released in theaters, and had different endings?

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
One of these days, you'll walk into the theater to watch Demon Wind, and it'll be the ending that makes sense.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I keep buying Blu-rays, hoping, like, a new Blu-ray will be different.
And I'm, and I'm always hoping that at some point of, of Demon Wind, someone orders the fish burger for $0.50.

JAY:
Is that on the menu?

MIKE:
It's on the menu.

JAY:
There's a fish burger?

MIKE:
It's all...
There's no, there's no, uh...
The menu's quite fascinating.
There's no vegetarian options.
It's, it's all, like, weird disgusting food that cost $0.50.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
See.
Oh.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
Pastrami.
Ham sandwich.
Fish burger!

MIKE:
Fish burger.
Hot link sandwich.
Uh...
Oh, can we get back to the menu?
Okay.
Fried chicken.
Barbecue beef sandwich.
Uh, so they have a lot of meat, meat options.
And that's it.
And nobody paid for their cokes or,or their beer.
Originally, I thought it was Ireland, but it was shot in Thousand Oaks, California, outside of Los Angeles by the roll, rolling hills of Thousand Oaks, California.
Which is doubling for some kind of country area somewhere.
It's rather vague.

JAY:
A Thousand Oaks?
Is what it's called?

MIKE:
Thousand Oaks...

JAY:
Thousand Oaks

MIKE:
California.
It's a city.

JAY:
That's where a thousand, uh, struggling actors live.

MIKE:
Oh.
Thou-, a thousand jokes?
That's what we got for you on this commentary track, ladies and gentlemen.

JAY:
Commentary track?
We're in a movie theater.

MIKE:
Sorry.
That's what we should say while we're in this movie theater as aliens.

JAY:
It's a good thing that there's no other people watching this movie, or they'd be very upset that we keep talking over it.

MIKE:
Right.
They would miss the plot.
Anyways, whenever you guys are ready, I could tell you the lineage.

RICH:
Yes.
I'm ready right now to know the lineage of these characters I don't care about.

MIKE:
Well, it's not, it's not so much about these characters.
It's more of the backstory...

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
Of the entire premise of the film.
But here, our harbinger of doom is warning them to go, not go to the cabin.
Even though at the end of the film -- spoilers -- he is an insane priest, uh, and who turns into the son of Satan and his legion of demons are there.
So you think he would want to add more to his legion of demons by luring these unsuspected, unsuspecting kids to their, the grandparents's farm to be turned into demons, right?
Instead of warning them away.
Right, Rich?

RICH:
It's reverse psychology.
It was very effective.

MIKE:
Okay.
You think, you think he was going for reverse psychology?

JAY:
Oh, no.
Who invited Dracula?

MIKE:
Rich, more friends are showing up.
These are the magician friends.

RICH:
Do, do we, do we need more friends?

MIKE:
No.
Or, or magicians.
These are, this is the early roles for Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon as man in a dracula costume?

JAY:
He's a magician!
That's a magician's cape.

MIKE:
It'sl...
Okay.
Sure.

JAY:
Harcourt is not impressed.
Now, Mike, you've seen this before, right?

MIKE:
Yes, I have.

JAY:
You've seen this 14 times before?

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes, I have.

JAY:
Uh, I'm assuming, like, they're really hammering it in that this guy's a magician.
I'm assuming that's going to pay off later, right?

MIKE:
Uh, the, no.
The kicking pays off.
He's a, he's a kung fu magician.
Rich, look.

RICH:
Oh, my god.
I saw you, I saw you do that.

MIKE:
Yeah, he's...

RICH:
You did that thing.
Earlier today.

JAY:
Were you trying to re-enact this movie?

MIKE:
I was.
The famous can-kicking scene.

JAY:
It's a staple of most magic acts.

MIKE:
And I don't know why anyone would show up in a tuxedo doing magic tricks when you're going on a quest to find your friend's dead grandparents's burned down cabin.

JAY:
Apparently, he brought a rabbit with him, too, just to do this one trick.

MIKE:
Actually, he just did the smoke bomb thing, and then the rabbit happened to be there.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
So it's, like, fortuitous, you know?

JAY:
Wow.
That's great.

RICH:
He has dozens of rabbits on his person at all times just in case something comes up.

JAY:
You never know.

MIKE:
Rich, it's Sean Penn, not Richard Gere.

JAY:
Are they both magicians?
Or is this the magician's assistant, and they couldn't get an actress?

RICH:
There can be two magicians.

JAY:
I disagree.

MIKE:
I, I honestly, I don't know.
I was surprised to find that this was, uh, a film made in the US.
I mean, it has all the markings of, like, a weird Italian movie.

JAY:
Trying to make something American.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Magic!

MIKE:
But it was shot in Los Angeles by people in the Hollywood system.
Low-budget, of course, but...

RICH:
They didn't even know?

JAY:
No.
They've all been driving for hours to go to an undisclosed location for unknown reasons.

RICH:
These are some good fucking friends.

MIKE:
There's not much to do in this, uh...
Well, I don't know where they're all from.
I don't think the movie ever tells us.

RICH:
"I drove four hours to be here."
"What's going on?"

MIKE:
"And I wore my best tuxedo and Dracula cape."

JAY:
Well, I recognize the magician.
He's the only actor in the film I recognize.
And it's not because he looks like Kevin Bacon.
He's in the film Shock 'Em Dead where he played a nerd turned rock 'n roller.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
That, that has to eat souls.

MIKE:
Did we watch that?

JAY:
We've seen that film, yeah.
With Traci Lords.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's funny, because...

JAY:
"Son of a bitch and idiots."
That sounds like an Italian, uh...

MIKE:
"Son of a bitch and idiots."

JAY:
Something an Italian would write.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I was gonna say, it's funny, because there's also a porno actress in this, too.

JAY:
There is?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Is it the old man?

MIKE:
No.
The nudity lady who comes out of the woods and, and kind of lures them out of the house.
Remember?

JAY:
Oh.
No, I don't remember, because this is the first time I've seen this.

MIKE:
And I think all...

JAY:
You're the only one who's seen it multiple times now.

MIKE:
I think I looked up all these actors on, like, IMDB, and almost every one of them ended up in porn after this.

JAY:
Well, you know...

MIKE:
Whether it's softcore...
Remember all those softcore programs?
The Red Shoe Diaries.

JAY:
Oh, sure.

MIKE:
Passion something.
All those n-, all those titles were coming up.
All those Skinemax late night Skinemax flicks that Rich would tape on a VCR and label as "football game".
I knew what you were up to back in the day.
Why do you have so many VHS tapes labeled "football game"?
"Football game 1."
"Football game 2."
Ahh...

RICH:
That was the sticky one.

JAY:
"All right, everyone."
"We're back on the road."
"If anyone spots the plot, let me know."

MIKE:
Did they just throw garbage out of the car?

RICH:
They just, no.d
They just threw out their magician uniforms.

MIKE:
Oh.
Because they realized they weren't going to, like, a resort with people.

RICH:
Yeah.
But those probably were expensive.
I, I mean, that Dracula suit looked like a fairly nice Dracula suit.

JAY:
You would think, if he wants to be a professional magician, he would want to hold onto that.
Even if he's not gonna use it this weekend.

RICH:
It's, it's the magician code, Jay.
You're only allowed to use your outfit once.

JAY:
Then it must be destroyed.

RICH:
Yes.

JAY:
Do you think, like, some horror movies are made just as an excuse to, you know, film a movie with, like, gore, maybe some nudity.
Was this movie just as an excuse to film people driving?

MIKE:
And they found an egg with a bunch of maggots in it.

RICH:
Well, they didn't find it.
It's just sitting there off to the side.
They never saw it.

MIKE:
Oh.
It accidentally got in the shot?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.
Anway.
Oh.
Should I tell you all about the history?

RICH:
Yes, Mike.
Please tell me all about the history.
I'm waiting.

JAY:
We got time.

MIKE:
We need context.
Okay.
So June 8th, 1929.
Cory's father was born.
Should I go, should I go chronologically here?

RICH:
Yes, you probably should.

MIKE:
The Cor-, the farm...
Oh.
Oh.
I think I'm gonna have to wait.
Oh, look.
The grade school kids were doing Shakespeare in the park.

JAY:
Is this skeleton a part of the family lineage?

MIKE:
Uh, I don't know who the skeleton is.

JAY:
That's his Uncle Remus.

RICH:
I can't believe they left that up there for 30 years.

JAY:
More than 30.

RICH:
More than 30, yes.

JAY:
30 years ago is when grand...
Oh.
No.
Who died 30 years ago, Mike?

MIKE:
I, I have it all. 
I have it all written out.

JAY:
I, I, I...
You know, you keep saying that.

RICH:
I don't beileve him

MIKE:
I think the skeleton was burnt in 1931 in the opening of the film.

JAY:
That's what we saw in the opening, yeah.

MIKE:
So this is...
The movie came out in 1990, so we're gonna assume it's 1990.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, which is...

JAY:
So it's 60 years.

MIKE:
60...
Skeleton's been up there for 60 years.
And as Rich, you noted before, the ligaments that hold the bones together have not been burnt or rotted away.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
The skeleton remains intact.

RICH:
It's kind of amazing.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It does.
It just doesn't fall into pieces.
I guess there's no police in Ireland.
Or no one drives down this road ever.
I don't know.

RICH:
Like, literally ever.

JAY:
Does this take place in Ireland?
I know you said it was shot in California.

MIKE:
No.
I was just joking around because it looks like Ireland.

JAY:
Do they say where it's supposed to take place.

MIKE:
They...don't.
I think, I think we'd like to talk now about the set and, um, and wh-, what all this is before I get into the lineage.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
I may not have time to squeeze it in.
Oh, my god.
"What's the fucking problem, Bonnie?"
"You're studying to be an anthropologist."

RICH:
Oh, no.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
That's, that was Skeletor's brother.

RICH:
There's information we're getting here.
It's all completely irrelevant, isn't it?

MIKE:
Well, okay.
So this guy here is, is Cory's dad's brother.
Now let me, let me, let me get into the lineage here.

JAY:
Okay.
I'm, I'm waiting.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
I'm very excited.

MIKE:
So the film opens in 1931.

RICH:
Uh-huh.

MIKE:
And there's a body being burnt on a cross.
I don't know why.
But the, the two people we see in the opening of the film are Regina and George, which are the grandparents of Cory.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
But that's not where the story starts.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
The story really starts in the 1800's.
The farm was built by Cory's great-grandparents.
Uh, and they followed a guy named Anders who decided to start a satanic cult.
Uh, and the satanic cult killed three little girls.
And then the townsfolk gathered up all the satantic cult members and burned them all to death, potentially on this land.

RICH:
Ah.

MIKE:
Sort of like a, a Freddy Krueger'ish kind of act, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And they said,
"We don't want your satanic cult here."
Uh, and then flash-forward to 1931.
C-, the, Cory, Cory's, uh, uh, grandp-, uh, grandparents live on the farm.
Um, I, I have to stop because we have to talk about this.
Now watch this magic, Rich.
Wha?
Why do you think they did that?
I'm gonna give you 14 guesses.
Okay.
Watch this, though.
Watch this.
Ready?
Ready?
Watch this.
Now...

JAY:
They did it because it's magical and weird and creepy.

MIKE:
Now, see...
Watch, Rich.
Watch.
Are you watching?

RICH:
I'm watching.
I actually find this...
This is interesting right now.
The way she doesn't see him.
That's great.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Is it, what's it, why is it happening?

MIKE:
So they could film on a sound stage.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
You know why, Jay.

JAY:
Is it like,
"Oh, we already wrote our opening scene where the cabin blows up, but we have to have somewhere for our characters to go?"
So they'll just go to the remnants of the cabin...

MIKE:
I think the idea was that the...

JAY:
And magic happens?

RICH:
Just, just change the opening scene.
I'm assuming they didn't have a good exterior where they could film at.
They didn't know where to find...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Cabin in the woods.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's, that's, yes.
Exactly.
They, they wanted to make Evil Dead.
And they, they wanted a cabin in the woods in, in deep forest at night.
Dark spooky forest with, with smoke and moonlight.

JAY:
Instead, they don't have a cabin or woods.

MIKE:
Right.
So they had Thousand Oaks, California.
Rolling hills and 70-degree temperatures and no woods around.
They'd have to drive pretty far out of the Los Angeles area to find, like, spooky woods.
So they just set up, like, junk in the middle of nowhere, and then they go inside a magical cabin.

JAY:
And they, they use an existing set built for some high school production for their main location.

MIKE:
Right.
Oh, look, Rich.
Magic.

JAY:
Seamless.

MIKE:
I think you meant "seamfull".

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And there's grandma.
So...

JAY:
"She looks just how I remember her."

MIKE:
Her head fell off and she started on fire when the house blew up.
But the house is still there, but grandma's burnt up bones.

JAY:
No one ever cleared it out, I guess.

MIKE:
Nobody ever poked around here.
The cops never showed up.

JAY:
Then again, we are in a magical interior...

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
That doesn't really exist.

MIKE:
What, would, like, a police officer that drove to investigate the skeleton on a cross, like...

RICH:
Why, why does this look so bad?

MIKE:
Because it's an optical effect.

RICH:
But that should be the easiest effect to do and have it be pretty seamless, right?
Just put a camera on a fucking tripod.

MIKE:
Well, they did.

JAY:
Well, they did that.
But when, back in the days of film, you would have a little bit of fluttering in the film.

MIKE:
The film, yeah.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

MIKE:
No, no.
Don't do that.

JAY:
Oh, no.
The paper mache fireplace.

MIKE:
If you see creepy Latin written in blood on the wall, don't read it aloud.
Rich, she just woke up the demons.
The firecrackers are going off all over the place.
And blow up all the Jesus pictures.
But, um, I listened to the commentary from the DP.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And most of the movie was shot on, uh, short ends.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And of all sorts of different film stocks and brands.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And they were all, like, mislabeled and, and so they had different, like, film stocks.
And they, like, sent them off to the lab, and they would come back, like, like, black.
They were like,
"No, no, no."
"Sorry."
"That's, that's a, that's a fast speed film stock."

JAY:
Oh, Jesus.

MIKE:
And so, the, you, you'll notice it, uh, certain shots look, like, nice and clean.
And then towards the end of the film, they ran out of short ends, and they had to buy brand new film stock.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
So certain shots look really nice.
Some shots look crappy.
And, Rich, to explain what a short end is...

RICH:
That's the unused bits at the end of film?

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, from a real production when, they're, they're...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They're almost...

JAY:
Hey, now.
Are you saying Demon Wind is not a real production?

MIKE:
I am.

RICH:
Yes.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
They had...

JAY:
Just making sure.

MIKE:
"Uh, we got, uh, 50 feet left on this, this roll."
"Just change it out."

RICH:
"We didn't use it on Back to the Future."

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
"Ehh, we're gonna give it to Demon Wind."

MIKE:
Yes.
You go to the film people and go,
"Do you have any short ends?"
"Sure!"
"Here's a whole ton of 'em!"
And then you load up the camera with, with a little bit of footage, and then we got one shot where Dell pokes his head out of the car and says,
"My car won't start."
You know, that's all you need.

JAY:
You get one take.

MIKE:
Yep.
So it was, it was kind of a, a mess.
Buit, uh, considering, it looks pretty good.

JAY:
Sure.
Most of it looks fine.

MIKE:
So the demons, uh, are stopping their cars from starting, right?

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Demons won't let the batteries start the car.
That's what's going on.

JAY:
it's a weird thing to say, but...

MIKE:
"You're not gonna die, Bonnie."
"You're espeically not going to turn into a plastic doll and then start on fire."
"I'm almost certain that's not gonna happen to you, Bonnie."
"That will be very strange."
"Then I wouldn't have to bury you, right?"
"So I promise that I won't bury you, Bonnie."
"Because I woin't have to bury you if you turn if you turn into a plastic doll and then start on fire."
Oh.
Back to the lineage.
So, 1890's.
Satanic cult.
Farm got all burnt up.
Flash-foward to 1931.
Cory's grandparents are there.
It says Mrs. James, which I think is Cory's grandma, had triplets.
They were killed right after birth.
They weren't even human.
All the children were the same except for Cory's dad.

RICH:
Okay.

JAY:
Why was he different?

MIKE:
I don't know.
And then Cory's dad also had an older brother, which is the kid they show running up and spitting blood up.

JAY:
Spitting out blood, yeah.

MIKE:
So I guess she had five...

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Kids?
And the triplets...
I don't understand it.

RICH:
She had two normal kids and three demon babies.
I get it.
I get it.

JAY:
But the dialogue says she had four kids, and one of them was Cory's dad, right?

MIKE:
Mrs. James had triplets.

JAY:
Triplets.
Okay.

MIKE:
Killed right after birth.
They wasn't even human.
Uh, and that's it.
So his dad survived out of all the kids, I guess.
Oh.
The dad was in, um, an incubator during the events of the opening.
He was born in 1929.
The explosion and the demon attack happened in 1931.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So he was three years old and still in an incubator at the hospital.
And that's why his dad was able to survive.

RICH:
That's, that's really fascinating, Mike.

MIKE:
Okay.
I'm just saying.
Now here's the demon wind, everybody.

RICH:
Now, I've never seen this.
I have no idea what's gonna happen, but does he also have Alien Nation DNA in his bloodline?

MIKE:
Thermian DNA, Rich.
Thermian.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
So these are the three girls from the 1800's that were sacrificed to Satan.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Anders demonic cult.

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
These are not the three kids of Cory's grandma.

JAY:
That's who I would assume they are.

MIKE:
No.
Look at their attire.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
They're clearly...

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
Pre-1931.

JAY:
Why do we have so many lineages and three childrens?

MIKE:
I don't know.

RICH:
Are they related to the stick girl from earlier in the film?

MIKE:
No.
The stick girl is unrelated.

RICH:
What?

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
Oh, you weren't kidding.

MIKE:
Hey, is this one of those Cabbage Patch Kids?
These are worth a lot of money.

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh, no.

JAY:
Even if you plan for the worst, I bet none of them could've expected that to happen.

MIKE:
No.

RICH:
You know, that man sounds just like one of his friends turned into a doll and exploded.
That's an amazing acting job.

JAY:
It's a traumatic experience, so...

RICH:
He sold me on the emotion of the moment.

MIKE:
How would you process that, though, Rich?
I don't know if I could.

RICH:
"Oh, my god!"
"What the fuck?"
"What the motherfuck just happened?"
"Holy shit!"
"Did you see that?"

MIKE:
Then you'd start running with, like a, like a load in your pants.
And you'd fall down one of the hills and roll down in your own filth.

JAY:
That'd be really embarrassing if that happened to the blonde guy in this, because he's wearing white sweat pants.

MIKE:
I know.

JAY:
Ugh.

MIKE:
It was a poor choice with all that grass around, you know?

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, sweat pants are always a bad choice.

MIKE:
Dell is just secretly super worried about getting grass stains on his favorite white sweat pants.

JAY:
So are these two characters together?

MIKE:
They were.

JAY:
But now she's with, with, uh, uh, what's-his-face back there.

RICH:
Flash Thompson.

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes.

JAY:
"Flash Thompson."

MIKE:
And, and he's with Sean Penn now.

JAY:
Okay.
Okay.
They're gay magciians.

MIKE:
He switched teams.

JAY:
Okay.

RICH:
Is this the time for that conversation?

MIKE:
No.
Yeah, their friend just turned into a plastic doll and started a fire.
It's not really the time.

RICH:
Maybe they weren't that close to her.

MIKE:
Right.
They should've blamed, uh, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn and said that it was one of their magic tricks, right?

JAY:
Ooh.

MIKE:
That's what they call a setup and payoff.
"That was one of your fucking magic tricks, Kevin Bacon."
And he starts punching him.
"Bring her back."
"Bring her back, bro."

JAY:
Hey.
That's good.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Like, one of them just doesn't believe anything that ever happens in the film.

MIKE:
Because he's...

RICH:
In the entire film.

MIKE:
Yeah.
We've established these two guys show up as magicians.
And then they think they're playing a prank on 'em, right?

RICH:
Other friend's head just, just explodes and brain matter all over the place.
"Stop doing your magic tricks, Dave!"

MIKE:
Exactly.
Rich, how did they get this footage of your house.

RICH:
They gave me $20.

MIKE:
Yeah?
Is this, is this the house you grew up in?
All these pictures of JEsus and garbage all over the floor?

RICH:
Yeah.
After I fixed it up a bit.

MIKE:
Okay.
You cleaned up for the film crew?

RICH:
You know, I gotta film a movie at my house.

MIKE:
Do you have a fireplace made of construction paper and tin foil?

JAY:
Now why are they cleaning up?

MIKE:
I don't know.
Because they gotta spend the night there.
And who wants to spend the night where a bunch of firecrackers blew up a turkey, and blasts right...
Not me.

JAY:
That's, that's a good point.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
To be, to be fair, they can't leave.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And they, they, they ruled out sleeping in their cars because one character said,
"I don't wanna sleep in a Cadillac with you, bro."
Look, he's got the, like, the, the, the little things that a magician...

JAY:
Oh, hey.
He's doing a magician thing.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Just in the very edge of the frame for no reason.
I'm sure we're gonna get a big payoff to his magic skills.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You bet we are.

JAY:
I can't wait.

MIKE:
You bet we are, everybody.
What else is on this sound stage?

RICH:
Well, they're filming Cheers right next to this.

MIKE:
Just a ghost.

JAY:
Was that, was that his...
That wasn't his mom.
That would be his grandma.

MIKE:
His grandma.
Goddammit.
I just explained the lineage.

JAY:
I'm trying to keep track of the lineage.

MIKE:
His mother and his...
His mother is not in the film at all.
His father is.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
We don't know what happened to his mother.

JAY:
I was about to ask,
"Did I miss something with the mother?"

MIKE:
No.
It's just not important.
I don't know.
Maybe she died at some point.
I don't know.
It's the, really, of the grandparents and the great-grandparents.
Okay, Jay?

JAY:
Okay.
I'll take your word for it.

RICH:
Maybe his mother was an Alien Nation alien.
His mother, his mother was a Thermian.

MIKE:
There you go.
Whoa!
Doctor Egon Spangler's ghost is here.
It's his proton pack.
So this is grandma's, uh, diary, right?

RICH:
It's the Necronoticon?

MIKE:
Necronoticon?
Did you just slip that in there, like, all casually-like?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or was that just, did you just mispronounce it...

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
And it happened to work?

RICH:
No.

JAY:
That's a quality joke...

MIKE:
It is.

JAY:
That you probably should've given more prominence?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You just said it so offhand.

MIKE:
You did.
Yeah.
I mean, it was really spot on.
"Necronoticon."
I think that was an accident.

RICH:
No.
I, I thought of that before we filmed.

MIKE:
Okay.
So we'll call it the Necronoticon.
Uh, grandma's diary and she writes in, I dunno, some kind of ancient language.

JAY:
Well, this part's not her diary.
This was a book she just found, and then she took over.
So this page here...

MIKE:
Oh, what?

JAY:
She started writing in sharpie.
This is where grandma took over.

MIKE:
How did the edges get so perfectly burnt?

JAY:
Well, she bought it at the Michael's around Halloween time.

MIKE:
Someone took a lighter to the edges to try to age them.

JAY:
I'm sorry.
What was that?
I wasn't listenting.

MIKE:
What's that?
Oh.
She made him a bologna sandwich.
I'm sure the bologna from 1931 is still good.

JAY:
They had a cooler.

MIKE:
Oh, they did?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They brought...

JAY:
One of them was holding a cooler.

MIKE:
They brought sandwiches?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I guess no one knew where they were going.

JAY:
You gotta plan ahead.

MIKE:
Someone brought their swimsuit.
They brought a cooler full of beer and sandwiches.
They thought there...

JAY:
A magician brought a bunch of rabbits...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And, uh, doves.

MIKE:
He thought he was gonna be playing a show, like, doing a magic act.
They thought they were driving down to Cancun.

JAY:
Depending on how the rest of their weekend goes, they're gonna be eating those rabbits.

RICH:
It's a, it's a great scam, really.
You know, you tell all your friends,
"Hey, I got an idea."
"We're gonna have a mystery vacation."
"Prepare for anything!"
"You never know what we're gonna do!"
And then they show up, and you're just like,
"Oh, yeah."
"You're gonna help me move."

JAY:
"You're gonna help me clean out this demonic cabin."

RICH:
"You're gonna, you're gonna help me clean out my, my dead grandmother's demonic cabin."

MIKE:
His, his plan worked real well because everyone got whittled down except for him and his girlfriend.
So he invited the proper amount of people to solve the mystery.
Figure out what was going on at his grandparents's cabin.d
And he eliminated eleven of his friends.

JAY:
Maybe he doesn't like any of those people, and that was his goal all along.

MIKE:
Exactly.
He was tired of getting invited to their, like, parties and, uh, events and stuff.

RICH:
He successfully killed off all of his girlfriend's ex's.

MIKE:
There you go.
That's it.

JAY:
Evil Dead has a dagger.
What if we had two daggers?

RICH:
That'll mean our movie is twice as good, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, my god!
Not issue #1 of Good Housekeeping!
That's worth a fortune!
I saw it on Antiques Roadshow once.
Yeah.
So the dagger is the, the...
I think grandma's journal said seven daggers will kill the son of Satan.
I don't know how she knew that.
Uh, but, uh, they, they only have two.
Five are missing.
Five of the daggers are missing.
I don't know.

RICH:
Why, why, why...

MIKE:
She will with that information, Cory.

RICH:
Like, they never find the daggers, right?

MIKE:
No.

RICH:
The other daggers?

JAY:
No.

RICH:
Why even bring that up?

MIKE:
Uh, well, because they use the daggers to stab demons.

RICH:
I know that.
But why bring up that there are five lost ones?

MIKE:
I don't know.
You'd think at the end they'd find them.
"We need all seven!"

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then they're buried out and they have to run and get them and son of Satan is running after them.
And then they have to get to the special spot where the other five daggers are buried before the moon rises or something.

RICH:
"We have to solve the cryptic clues to figure out where they are."

MIKE:
Right.

RICH:
You get, you get some thing happening.

MIKE:
Rich, you gotta stop watching movies, okay?
You, your, your knowledge of how a movie is, is constructed is just far, far too good.

RICH:
I know.
It hurts me when I actually watch movies.

MIKE:
It's, it's a detriment.
It's, it's be-, it's becoming a, a, a crippling handicap on your part for enjoy-, enjoying films like Demon Wind.
"Like, why doesn't, why don't they do the co-, most logical thing?"
"Why doesn't this make any sense?"

JAY:
Maybe streamline all the, uh, the family stuff.

MIKE:
Sure.

RICH:
Maybe they were hoping for, like, sequels.
"Well, we can bring the other daggers back in Demon Wind II."

JAY:
Oh, there ya go.

MIKE:
Mm.
No.

JAY:
Is this, like, a precursor to the MCU?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
You're just planting seeds for future Demon Wind universe films.

MIKE:
There was a sequel that was gonna happen.
They they thought,
"Better not."
That's just true.

RICH:
That's not even a joke.

JAY:
The straightforwardedness, straightforwardness of that is what made it funny.
They just, they were in the theater.
They were watching the dailies and they said,
"We better not."

RICH:
It's Comic Con.
They have, they have the press conference.
They, they show the chart with the, with the timeline, and it just says Demon Wind, and then the line just goes on into the future with nothing coming off of it.

MIKE:
It ends with bankruptcy.

RICH:
"Releasing in 1999...Demon Wind."

JAY:
"The end."

RICH"
"The end."

MIKE:
Okay.
Here we have our two magician characters, uh, trying to be lured out by an elderly porn star.

JAY:
One of these actors said,
"I think my mom would do some nudity."

MIKE:
Oh.

RICH:
She is a MILF.

JAY:
I don't ever want to hear you say that again.

MIKE:
Please never...
Yeah.
Don't ever say that.
The movie literally put everyone to sleep.
Except for them.
They, they decide to go out together and fight demons to the death for no reason whatsoever.

JAY:
Well, that's, yeah.
They, they just acknowledged that they understand that topless lady is actually a demon.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So you think if they understand that, they would just stay inside.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Shoot at her from the window.

MIKE:
Sure.

RICH:
You have long-range weapons.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why do they even go outside?

RICH:
Oh, so they can die.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And the, and the, the, the demon, the lady, or just whatever force is at work here puts everybody else to sleep.

RICH:
Or just wake your friends up and tell them what you plan to do.

MIKE:
But they were, they were put to sleep.
I don't think they were sleeping naturally.
I think the demon wind put them to sleep.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
Or whatever evil force is at work here lured them out for no reason.

JAY:
I was gonna say, what is the demon's plan?
What does the demon want?
Why can the demon not go in the cabin?

MIKE:
Why do you, why are you using demon in the singular?

JAY:
Well, demons.
I don't understand.
It's a demon wind, so...

RICH:
Jay, they saw Evil Dead, and they know how it works.

JAY:
Well...

RICH:
You can't go in the cabin.

JAY:
Okay.

RICH:
Flimsy cabin.
Should be easily able to get in.
They can't do it.

MIKE:
Well, Jay, this is, this was made in 1990, right?
So we're talking, like, uh, the age of the home, home video market trash, right?
Or maybe a little late than that?
But what I'm thinking is, yeah.
They, they slapped a crap movie together with some things that you could put on the box.
People in demon's m-, masks, right?
Some...
And write nudity, because they had the lady's boobs in it, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Put that, right?
Ladies in evil demonface on the box, a couple of guns, and then boom, you got a thing that people can buy, right?

JAY:
Uh, sure.

MIKE:
Rent.
And...

JAY:
It looks sort of like a movie.

MIKE:
It looks sort of like a movie, and...
I don't know.
That's my cynical take on it is that they didn't really care about the plot.
They just wanted six or seven elements in it that they could advertise a junk horror movie with, right?
I mean, you know all this stuff.

JAY:
I, I know how, how it goes.

RICH:
You don't think this was made with passion and heart?

MIKE:
I, I, I don't.
What I do know is that all the demons were filled with Cheez Whiz for some reason.
They ran out of, like, green slime.

RICH:
Nacho cheese is pretty easy to come by.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Maybe one of the actors worked at, like, like a ball park or something.
He stole, like, one of those, a couple of those giant cans of nacho cheese.
Oh, no.
Something got Sean Penn in the neck and ripped open his jugular.

JAY:
It was, it was demonic force.
Something happened.

RICH:
We've established that the demons can do whatever they want.
I mean, they turned somebody into an exploding doll.

JAY:
Yeah.
You really shouldn't start with that.

MIKE:
I think that...
I don't know.
Oh.

RICH:
Whoa!

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
The karate kicking paid off.
Remember when he kicked the, the can of soda around, Rich?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And they kicked it right in Dell's face.

JAY:
And now he'll never do it again.

RICH:
Then he's just gonna die.
And that was, that was nice.

JAY:
What a great payoff.

MIKE:
They, why didn't they...
They go out with guns blazing.
Why didn't they go out and use magic tricks to trick the demons?
Rich?

RICH:
That could be a fun thing you do, like, later in the film when you have the big plan for getting out.
And then use the magic trick as some kind of distraction.

MIKE:
Mm.
Uh-huh.
Here's grandma.
See all those demons and all the old period clothing where the de-, the, the townsfolk from the 1800's that followed Anders's satanic cult and all got burnt up by the villagers.

RICH:
Oh.
Oh.

JAY:
Okay.

RICH:
Maybe he's running from, like, a demon...

MIKE:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
In the house.
And so then, like, he, he hops into a cabinet, and then the demon opens the cabinet, and it's empty.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Rich, that is just so simple and perfect.

RICH:
Then we cut.
We see them running outside the house to, like, where the car is to get the dagger.

MIKE:
He leaves his magic hat and, uh, the demon looks into it, and a rabbit jumps out of the hat and claws at the demon's face.
How about that?

JAY:
What if he saws a demon in half?
That's not, like, a magic trick.
He just saws it in half.

MIKE:
No.
And then the two halves of the demon regrow on each side and make two demons.

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

RICH:
So many clever things you can do if you have half a brain,
I mean, really, just half a brain.
Yes.
You tell them that because you're in a magical, awful situation.
They'll probably believe you.

JAY:
At this point, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh.
Is this when he decided to, to not tell his friends about his grandma's spellbook?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Yeah.
After the first girl turned into a doll and started on fire...

JAY:
All bets are off then.

MIKE:
That's when you tell them everything.

JAY:
Just oipen up.

MIKE:
"My grandparents, uh, had a demon house, and you're all in it."
"Whoops."

JAY:
So, in addition to the satanic cult, his grandma was a witch.
And that's not related to the demon magic.
That's her own magic.

MIKE:
I don't know.

JAY:
And she uses spells to keep the demons away from her family.
Right?

MIKE:
Yes and no.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
The, well, see, there's religious, uh, uh, symbolism around, right?
There's pictures of Jesus and all that.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then there's a pentagram on the floor.
And then there's, like, Wiccan symbols.
And then there's also a crucifix on the door.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's a little mishmosh of a little bit of everything.

RICH:
You're assuming they, they knew, or thought it out.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I, I, I think they just said whatever.
Um, the crucifix on the door, but also some kind of mystical...

JAY:
But also, she's a witch.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she cast spells, right?

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
Typically, uh, spells and magic and, and witch stuff isn't in line with Christianity.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, she's maybe, maybe, you know...

RICH:
Well, that's what Voodoo is.

MIKE:
But not Christianity.

RICH:
I think there's some weird mishmosh there.

MIKE:
Okay.
Well, maybe she was a Voodoo priest lady.
I don't know.
She, I think she just, maybe she just went with whatever could possibly work to keep the demons away, right?
"A couple of Jesus pictures."
"Why noit?"
"And then some spells."
"I'll do that, too."

JAY:
They should've just moved.

MIKE:
Guns, sure.

JAY:
Oh, good.
More characters.

MIKE:
"Should've just moved."

JAY:
The whole point in introducing your group of characters is to have 'em get killed off.
And now we've killed off two characters, and introduced two more to take their place.

MIKE:
"How many people did you invite on this trip?"
"Don't shut it off."
"It's a Suzuki."
"It might not start again."
"Also, there's demons."

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
Demons, demons can shut the battery of your car off, Rich.

JAY:
But, apparently, they can onnly do that after the car is already stopped.

MIKE:
Right.
Yes.

RICH:
Demons can only prevent things from starting.

MIKE:
So, two new friends have arrived.

RICH:
But, but why?

MIKE:
Also...

RICH:
No.
I'm serious.
Why are there two friends?
Why did the movie need two new friends to show up?

MIKE:
I, I honestly don't know, other than more bodies, but...

RICH:
Can't they just show up with everyone else in the beginning?

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Well, everybody...

RICH:
It seems like an odd choice to have just two more just show up randomly.

MIKE:
Sure.
Uh, yeah.
They have enough people to kill off at this point.
I mean, there's still four more characters floating around.

JAY:
Is it possible that two of the actors quit, and so they just replaced them with two new characters?

MIKE:
I would normally think that, but I, I didn't hear any signs of that on any of the interviews that I listened to.
Also, they all met up at the gas station, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But then these two new characters somehow knew where his grandparents farm was.
I, I don't know...

JAY:
Well, they, they read the script.

MIKE:
Oh.
Okay.
So Dell and, and his girlfriend are deciding to just leave.
They said,
"We're not gonna spend another night here."
"We're just gonna walk and hope that the same thing that happened before doesn't happen again."
Right?

JAY:
I mean, I guess.
What other choice do you have?

MIKE:
They just nailed those, those quarter-inch pieces of plywood to the door, Jay.
I mean, the house is now secure.

JAY:
The door that is also made of quarter-inch plywood?

MIKE:
Right.
They never told those new characters what's going on.

RICH:
They're just very confused.

MIKE:
They're just...

JAY:
I don't know if these new characters have another line of dialogue for the rest of the film.

MIKE:
They're just, like, uh,
"Start nailing boards to the window."
"We're in a situation here."

JAY:
"But what's happening?"

RICH:
"What happened to our magician friends?"

JAY:
Presto!
They disappeared.

RICH:
"And why is there a burnt up doll on the front lawn?"

MIKE:
"We don't talk about the doll."
"We're all kind of traumatized by that."
"And why hasn't Cory told us about his grandma's spells and the demons?"

JAY:
"And why is the fireplace made of construction paper?"

RICH:
Why is the fireplace made of construction paper?

MIKE:
Because it's a cheap set.
That's why.
Whoa!

JAY:
Oh!
There goes the set.

MIKE:
Grandma's ghost did that.

JAY:
Yeah.
I guess that's another thing.
We have a satanic cult.
We have grandma was a witch.
And now we also have ghost grandma.
So we have demons, witches, and ghosts.

MIKE:
Ghost grandma just showed up to tell him where her, uh, diary was.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
And then she never shows up again.
And also, he has some kind of psychic connections.
You remember, he touched the skull of his dad's brother that was in the dirt?

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
And then electricity came out, and then he knew he had a flashback where the dad's brother spit up blood.

JAY:
Does the dad's brother tie in with anything?

MIKE:
No.
No.

JAY:
What was the point of that scene?

MIKE:
The dad, the dad's older brother -- the kid with the overalls -- he's running up and he spits blood out.

JAY:
I, I remember the scene, but why was that there?

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
Why did these people show up?
Why are there five missing daggers?

MIKE:
Because his grandma had three kids.
They were triplets.
But the dad has an older brother.
Triplets usually don't rage in ange-, ages, right?

JAY:
That's true.

MIKE:
They were born at the same time.

JAY:
That's why they're triplets.

RICH:
I mean, that'd be a fucked up pregnancy, but...

MIKE:
Yeah.
It would be a really weird pregnancy.
Abnormal.

JAY:
If they're born at different times, then they're just siblings.

MIKE:
Right.
Yes.
But the triplets were killed right after birth.
And they wasn't even human.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
I don't know why.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
So she had demon triplets, but then she had his, his dad and his dad's older brother, which would be his uncle.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
I'm sure she's not a demon.
I mean, I'm sure.
She's just facing away...

MIKE:
Oh, no!

RICH:
Oh, no?

JAY:
She's a demon!

MIKE:
Rich, you were wrong.

JAY:
And she has chopsticks for fingers.
Ugh.
My grandfather went the exact same way.
I guess she stabbed him in the brain?

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's why one eye doesn't work.
I kind of like that.
It's just...
It fucked all his...

RICH:
She hit that random nerve that went to the eye.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Why not?

RICH:
Okay.
Well, they're dead now, I guess.

MIKE:
No.
They're now demons.
Okay.
So here's there only plan, which is...

JAY:
To walk to the barn.

MIKE:
They, they, they...
Rich, what you described as the, the yuppie Harry Potter, says,
"I saw remnants of an old barn over there."
"Maybe, just maybe, that's the source of all the demon's powers."

RICH:
Look.
Considering Cory won't tell them about the fucking spellbook, which is their best chance, they're working with what they have, which,
"I felt something with the barn."
"Maybe we can do something there."
"This house isn't working for us."

MIKE:
"Let's go check out the barn."
"Uh, it could be the source of the demon power."

RICH:
"Maybe we'll find an anti-demon device in the barn."
"Or we, maybe there's a portal of hell there."
"We can close it."

MIKE:
Sure.

RICH:
I don't know.

MIKE:
I, how...

JAY:
Or maybe there's nothing there.

MIKE:
How to do that, I don't know.
May-, maybe they...
Like, I would maybe try to start the barn on fire, right?
Knock it down?

RICH:
Sure.
Sure.
Why not?

JAY:
I, I mean, they could try anything.
It really doesn't matter because they don't know what's happening.

MIKE:
They're just gonna go look around the barn.
The barn, they think if they pass through the door of the barn, it'll have an interior like the house.

JAY:
Well, they were right there.

RICH:
Look.
This is, this is just like Scooby-Doo.
They have to investigate the mystery.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
Before we find out this whole thing was just a ploy by old farmer Brown.

MIKE:
To get people to go to his gas station?

RICH:
He's trying to scare people away from this gas station.

MIKE:
He's trying to sell the most fish burgers in the county.
Oh.
Looks like a barn to me.

RICH:
Oh.
The rival gas station also sells fish burgers...

MIKE:
Mm.

RICH:
So it's the demon ploy to scare people away from the other gas station.

MIKE:
That's already a better movie.
Oh.

JAY:
Have our two new characters said anything?

RICH:
No.
They're just here.

JAY:
They're just there.

RICH:
They're, they're literally, they're just here because halfway through, the movie decided it needed some more bodies.

JAY:
Well, I hope one of them doesn't get their head squeezed by a cow skull.

RICH:
Oh, my god.
That's a cow skull.

JAY:
Oh, no!
It's gonna happen, isn't it?

RICH:
How did you know, Jay?


MIKE:
Isn't it more, more typical a goat...

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Than a cow?

RICH:
But they didn't have a large impressive...

MIKE:
How do you have all these answers?
Are you just speculating, Rich?

RICH:
I'm just...
Baseless speculation, yes.

JAY:
Rich was part of the production.
He was hanging out with Lou Diamond Phillips behind the camera.

MIKE:
Right.
Oh.
She said something.
She's very...
She's lured into the, the, the satanic sk-, skeleton.
Oh, my god.

RICH:
Okay.
I'm taking it back.
The barn was a bad idea.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Why don't they continue to help her after she gets her head in there?
I mean, they could pull on the jaw, right?

JAY:
They, they've done all that they can do.

RICH:
There's a lot of things they could do.

MIKE:
They just, like, let go and just watch, watch what happens.

JAY:
She looks like she's smiling.

MIKE:
I like that the blood gets in her mouth and she's, like...

JAY:
Plfft!

MIKE:
Spitting it out.
Like, you'd really be doing that if your head was being crushed?
You knnow what I mean?
Like, that is sort of, like,
"Eww, gross."
"Ugh."
"There's blood in my mouth."
That sort of...
That instinct turns off when your skull is being crushed, I think.

JAY:
See, the gay magicians are back.
They should do some magic now.
Some demonic magic.
Some sort of, like, uh, variation of one of their magic tricks from earlier.
Like, they pull a pigeon out of their jacket, but it's just a skeleton or something.

MIKE:
It's, like, a raven.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And it starts pecking their eyes out.

JAY:
Hey.
There you go.

RICH:
Or, you know, they take off the top hat, and they make maggots appear.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
See, even the basic amount of creativity can just, falls out of our buttholes.

JAY:
Well, why even introduce them as magicians?

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
Or they, they do, like, you know, the endless handkerchief?
But it's, like, endless intestines?

JAY:
Ooh!
That's good.

MIKE:
They start,
"We've got a couple of magic tricks for you."
And then a whole bunch of, like, like, uh, hay, hay bails come out, and then -- pffft! -- they sit down on 'em, and then, like...

JAY:
Like a little stage?

MIKE:
Chains lock 'em in.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, all these, like, weird things.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And they start doing a magic show, and then they say,
"We need a volunteer from the audience!"
Right?

RICH:
Then they saw one of them in half, but it's for real.

MIKE:
Yes.
Sure, why not?

JAY:
How about instead of that, they just stand there and everybody runs away?

MIKE:
And goes back into the cabin.

JAY:
And goes back into the cabin.

MIKE:
Jay, that is great.
That just saved them $50,000 of their budget.

RICH:
Which one is that?

MIKE:
Those are their new friends.

RICH:
Oh.
That's the one who just got eaten by the cow.

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
She's a demon already.
Okay.

MIKE:
And that's her boyfriend with the white jacket.
So this is dagger #1?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
It's used to kill one demon.

MIKE:
That's the girl that got her head crushed by a cow skull.
And then she...

RICH:
This is an easy acting gig for her.

MIKE:
Right?

RICH:
She's in two scenes.
She shows up halfway through the movie, and then she dies right away...

JAY:
Well, she had to get blood on her head.
That was probably mildly inconvenient.
Trying to think of a joke about their wigs.

MIKE:
I know.

JAY:
It's just not coming to me.

MIKE:
I know.
They're really bad wigs.
Because you don't need to make a joke.
It already is a joke.

JAY:
I guess, yeah.
We don't even need to keep talking, do we?
Just let the movie play out.

MIKE:
Here come all the zombies, or demon zombies coming out of the barn.

JAY:
Why now?

MIKE:
Yes.
Well, they, they've, they stirred up the hornet's nest, you know?

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
They shouldn't have gone in that barn.
Right, Rich?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
What do you think happened?

RICH:
I don't...

MIKE:
Why were these, these demons in, in the barn?
Oh, my god.

RICH:
If, if I were writing this, there would be, like, like some kind of spell or something that the demons were trying to complete.
And maybe they needed, you know, more sacrifices to finish the spell?

MIKE:
You're talking about a plot?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh.

RICH:
A story.

MIKE:
Like a ticking clock element?
Like something we have to root for that they hope to avoid?

RICH:
Something our, our heroes need to stop.

MIKE:
Yeah.
The spell, once the spell is completed, uh...

RICH:
Then Satan comes out of the Earth.

MIKE:
The, the portal to hell...

RICH:
That's how it usually works, right?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's that?
Wh-, wh-, what's a, what's a, what's a...
Rich, you'll know this.

RICH:
Uh-huh.

MIKE:
I'm not even gonna bother asking Jay.
Uh, a word, a word, uh, a sym-, a synonym.
What's the opposite of a synonym?
An antonym, right?

RICH:
I think so.

MIKE:
What's an antonym of "thriller"?
Because I wanna say, you know, I wanna make a joke.
I'm working on...

RICH:
"Chiller".

MIKE:
No.

RICH:
No, for real.
You want something for real.

MIKE:
And it has to rhyme.
See, that's the problem.
That's the joke, is you want an antonym of "thriller", so you could say...

RICH:
"Subdued"?

MIKE:
Uh, uh...

JAY:
I don't think that you'll...

MIKE:
"Filler"?
"Filler"?

JAY:
"Filler."

MIKE:
"Because this is filler!"

JAY:
That's not bad.

MIKE:
See?
I did it.
I'm a professional joke maker.
Right?
I just had to work that out.

RICH:
It, it took a lot of effort.

MIKE:
Can I sing that a little bit?
"Because this is filler..."
Right?
Without...

JAY:
You can probably get away with that.

MIKE:
Okay.
And it's a parody.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's par-, protected under parody clause 3189 of the U.S. Constitution.
"Because this is filler."
"It's a fiiller night."
Okay.
So grandma cast a spell, some kind of spell of protection on the ruins of the house.
And then the, the protection spell worked until it stopped working.
Too many demons, maybe?
I'm trying to...

JAY:
The spell knows how many demons are out there?

MIKE:
The spell only worked for, like, five demons, and then, like, eight or twelve came out.

RICH:
Maybe the spell's just wearing off.
It's a 60-year old spell.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
That's some very bad timing for our characters then.

MIKE:
It was just, like, the last day that it was still valid.
"The spell is good for 59-and-one-quarter yearrs."

JAY:
Well, that's what our character gets for procrastinating.
Cory could've done this at any time throughout his life.
Gone and investigate this cabin.

MIKE:
Well, actually, no, Jay.
That's wrong.

JAY:
Oh.
Oh.

MIKE:
He decided to look his father up for no reason.
After 20 years.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Then his father killed himself.
And after his father killed himself, he heard a voice in his head that said you have to go and investigate your grandparents's cabin.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
Perhaps that voice was demonic in nature.
Um, but it, it, he was, he was lured there.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
After, only after his father died.

JAY:
Well, this is such a, such a complicated plot, I can't keep track.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And you're missing, really, the basics of it.

JAY:
Are you saying we're not currently watching an episode of Star Trek?

MIKE:
We are not.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Despite all the aliens and science fiction elements.
We are indeed watching a horror picture.

JAY:
Called "Satan Farts".

MIKE:
Or maybe it's a comedy.
I'm not sure.

RICH:
Maybe that's the problem when, when Alex Kurtzman was researching Star Trek...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Because he just got hired to write for Star Trek, instead of watching, you know, TNG, he accidentally, somebody gave him a copy of Demon Wind.

MIKE:
Oh.
Right.
Labeled it...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Star Trek: The Next Generation"

RICH:
He was watching this.
"Well, I guess this was Star Trek."
"We need lots of guns and violence."

MIKE:
He's so...

RICH:
"And the plot can't make any sense."

MIKE:
Yeah.
He's so incredibly stupid that when, when he put it on, he, he didn't even notice.

RICH:
"Who's that one guy?"
"Is that Kirk?"

MIKE:
"That's Kirk with a shotgun, right?"

RICH:
"It's Kirk with a shotgun, yeah?"

MIKE:
"Monsters break into house."
He's writing notes with his crayons.

RICH:
"Is Spock the one who does the magic?"
Crayons.

MIKE:
So, Harry Potter guy got bit by a demon.

JAY:
And that turns him into a demon?

MIKE:
It does.

JAY:
That, that's a new piece of lore we've been introduced to, I guess.

MIKE:
It's, it's...
Again, you know, lots of hybridization going on here between demons and zombies and r-, religion and spellcasting and...
Anything goes in this movie.

JAY:
"Bonnie."

MIKE:
Oh.
That's her name.
Bonnie.

JAY:
She's not a doll anymore.

MIKE:
It's a, it's an apparition.
He's...
She's trying to lure him.
I...
Were they boyfriend and girlfriend?

JAY:
Yes.
I believe so.

MIKE:
But she also slept with Dell.

JAY:
Everybody slept with everybody.

MIKE:
And, and Diane, or Elaine slept with Dell, too, and the Harry Potter guy.

RICH:
Dell was a playa'.

MIKE:
He was.
He was.

JAY:
Was Dell white sweatpants?

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Oh, no.
Look.
They were whacking at the set.

RICH:
You know, this, this wants to be Evil Dead so bad.
I'm surprised yuppie Harry Potter did not cut his hand off.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
No.
There you go.
Well, they don't want to plagiarize too much.

RICH:
Just a little bit.

MIKE:
Just a little bit.

RICH:
Why are they tearing down the boards?
There's no...
Why would that work?
There's no house, really.

MIKE:
What are you talking about?

RICH:
I'm questioning the logic of the windows.

MIKE:
I'm, I don't know why he's using a gun constantly.
They got another dagger.
In, in there downtime, they really should've been learning all those spells.
Really reading that diary...

RICH:
Yes.
That would've made a lot of sense.

MIKE:
It seems to have a lot of information.
And then, and it's used at the end of the movie, like, extensively.
And then they start using it as, uh...

RICH:
I wonder if it was a complete afterthought.

MIKE:
What?

RICH:
Were the scenes with the book tacked on later?
The whole ending?

MIKE:
I don't know.

JAY:
When they realized they had no way how to conclude this story?

RICH:
Yeah.
Their teeth are all crooked in the same ways.

JAY:
It's almost like they were re-using the same prop teeth.
Hopefully they, they sanitize 'em between people.
Otherwise, Daniel Radcliffe's gonna be really upset.

MIKE:
Oh.
He gets a little demon boob groping.
Fun fact.
The close-up?
That was the hand of the director.
He felt he had to have, like, a, a part in the film.

JAY:
He, he knew exactly...

RICH:
He was the only one who knew the, the actions that needed to be performed for the scene to work.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There's a special way that a demon would grow breasts without permission, right?
And the, and this actor just wasn't, wasn't doing it right.

JAY:
Now is this...
This is the second dagger.

MIKE:
Yes.
Oh.
Oh.

RICH:
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?

JAY:
Oh.
It's a d-, it looks like a turkey leg...

RICH:
What?

JAY:
Or something there.

RICH:
I don't know what I just saw.

MIKE:
Rich, he turned into his normal self, then at 8-year old, then an infant, then a dove.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I mean...

JAY:
I mean, seeing it in, like, de-age kind of is something.

MIKE:
Well, we all start off as doves.

RICH:
But why, why de-age?

JAY:
I don't know.

MIKE:
"What's the plan, Elaine?"

RICH:
"Well, I figured we should start reading your grandmother's book."

MIKE:
"Let's start figuring out what's in that book."
"It seems like it could have some important information."
I hate this movie.
Why did I watch it 14 times?

RICH:
Because you're trying to figure it out.

JAY:
Does it make any more sense this time so far?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Oh.
So when this is over, should we just go back out to the lobby and buy another ticket?

MIKE:
Yeah.
I'm just gonna keep watching it until it makes sense.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
k"This is the worst trip to a demonic farmhouse ever."
"Wait."
"Those aren't demonic zombies."
"They're just people from Wal-Mart."

JAY:
So they use both the daggers now.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And the, the daggers are just gone.

RICH:
Wait.
What happened to their new friends that showed up?
Did they just, like, die off-camera?

MIKE:
Yeah.
They died.

RICH:
Off-camera?

MIKE:
No.
The girl got her head bit by the skull.

RICH:
Oh.
That was her.
You're right.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
The cow skull.

RICH:
How did the guy die?

MIKE:
I think she just slashed him.

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
Or she...
And then she attacked him in the barn.
Then she appeared later with his decapitated head.

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
At some point, she cut his head off.
Oh.
Somebody's coming to save him, Rich.
Well, not save him, but...

RICH:
Okay.

JAY:
"Okay."
I guess, maybe?

MIKE:
It's Harcourt, everybody.

RICH:
Oh, my god.
It's the guy from the gas station.

JAY:
And he's brought fish burgers for everyone.

MIKE:
So, I know I've, I'm the one who's seen this 14 times, but Harcourt is, is he just an old guy that wants to continue the, the demon cult?
Like, independently of...

RICH:
Or he's the old cult leader who just, because of demon magic, never died.

MIKE:
Oh.
You're talking about Anders.
He is Anders.

JAY:
Is he Anders?

RICH:
Yeah.
He might be Anders.

JAY:
I'm sure the movie will explain everything.

MIKE:
So all the demons turn, all their, they, uh, wh-, why, what?

JAY:
Oh, no.
It's Bonnie again.

MIKE:
Poor Bonnie.

RICH:
She can't get a fucking break.

MIKE:
So all the demons coalesce and turn into Bonnie so that the son of Satan can suck her life force out.

JAY:
What is the importance of Bonnie out of this entire group of people?

MIKE:
Maybe she's a virgin, right?
And, and that's why they kept her around?

JAY:
I mean...

RICH:
I thought she slept with Dell.

MIKE:
The funny thing is, she's had worse first dates.
He could've at least bought her dinner first.
But, yeah.
It was never setup that, that this is some kind of virginal sacrifice.
I think he just...
I d-, I don't know.
Oh, fucking, fuck it.

JAY:
Now is this Anders that is turned into Satan?

MIKE:
I think he g-, Anders gave his, his mortal body up to the son of Satan to possess it.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
But the son of Satan is so big and gross that he, he just popped out of his body and looks like a big fish sandwich.
A fish burger.
A burnt up fish burger.
I really don't know.

JAY:
He looks like a cancerous orc.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
From Lord of the Rings.

MIKE:
Uh, uh, an orc, orc with leprosy?

JAY:
Yeah.
Peter Jackson saw this movie and he said,
"I'm stealing this."

MIKE:
But he's not Satan himself, just so you know.
He's the son of Satan.

RICH:
There should be a touching sentimental story told within The Lord of the Rings universe about an orc who is dealing with cancer.
He has to break it to his orc family.

MIKE:
But then he just ends up going to, like, the battle of Helms Deep and getting killed.

RICH:
See, he's tried to do all the things, like, you know, within the two months he's got left to live.
All, he has to do all the things he wanted to do with his orc life.

MIKE:
That's good.
Oh, yeah.
See, he's wearing the clothes of Anders.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Or Harcourt.
Whoever it might be.
And it's all ripped apart.
So, yes.
Oh, no.
This isn't the time to do coke.

JAY:
Ah, cocaine.
A screenwriter's best friend.

RICH:
There's always time to do coke.
Oh, my god.
What?
What?
He's an alien?

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
This is an Alien Nation prequel.

MIKE:
He turned into a Thermian from Galaxy Quest.

JAY:
Did Cory know he could do this?

MIKE:
Well, when you pull cocaine out of your pocket and throw it on a li-, on a candle, Jay, anything can happen.

JAY:
Oh.
He just kicked the son of Satan in the nuts.

MIKE:
That's like, that's like when y-, when you're gonna try to defeat the son of Satan, that's n-, that's the first thing you try.

JAY:
Just, just kick him in the junk?

MIKE:
Kick to the balls.
And then after that, move onto other things.

RICH:
Is there any context explaining why Cory looks like a Thermian?

MIKE:
Uh, no.
I've speculated in the past that he has an, supposed to be an angel.
Um, because, because he's got, like, weird ears.

RICH:
Shouldn't there be some kind of dialogue in there establishing that this is a possibility?
Or hinting that this might happen?

MIKE:
It, it should be explained, yeah.
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna agree with you there.
Wh-, what's happening should be explained, right?

RICH:
"The only thing that can stop the demon is the earthly incarnation of the angel."
Something!
Something!

MIKE:
"It says here if we read these three lines, you can inhabit the body of the angel, which will allow you to do battle with the son of Satan."
"Can I be turned back into my normal self af-..."
"I don't know."
"It's a risk we're gonna have to take."

JAY:
To be fair to this movie, nothing like this happens in the Evil Dead.

MIKE:
No.

RICH:
No.
Nobody turns into an alien.

MIKE:
So, yeah.
He's impervious to being attacked...
What?
Oh, my god.
It was all a dream, everybody.

RICH:
The lamest of all endings.

MIKE:
But is it really?

RICH:
Has "it's all a dream" ever been satisfying?
Ever?
Wizard of Oz?

JAY:
Well, Wizard of Oz, it might not really all have been a dream.

RICH:
Yes.

JAY:
It could have theoretically happened.

MIKE:
Uh, inception?

JAY:
Is "it all a dream" an inception?

MIKE:
I don't know.
I don't remember anything about that.
I don't know.
Rich, your argument is invalid.

RICH:
Why is it...

MIKE:
I reject your hypothesis.

JAY:
I reject your reality and substitute my own?

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Oh, no!
It's not a dream!
God, this is such a fucking horror movie.
Lame horror movie cliche.

JAY:
The fake out...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Uh, ending?

MIKE:
It's been done in this film before, remember?
When Dell is trying to get fresh with his lady?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it, and she turned and it was Kevin Bacon with his face ripped off.
Oh.
Now Elaine is a demon.
And, and he's, she's gonna be the bride of the son of Satan.

JAY:
Why her?

MIKE:
Yes.
Because...

JAY:
I guess because she's the only one left.

MIKE:
She's the only female left, so...

JAY:
But the only reason all the other people are dead is because the demons killed 'em for no reason.

MIKE:
Because she's, she's Cory's girlfriend and we're supposed to care.

RICH:
Oh, wait.
Wait.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
The dream wasn't a fake out ending.
It was just a random thing that happened?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It was an illusion by Satan to make him think that he was back to normal.

RiCH:
Oh, that's so fucking weird.

MIKE:
Although he didn't keep the illusion up for very long.
And I think...

RICH:
That is so fucking weird.

MIKE:
It was so that Satan could turn Elaine into a demon and make her his demon bride.
But Cory woke up and interfered and turned her back into a person with his angel magic.
Aren't you following along?

JAY:
Is this a cameo by the director?

MIKE:
Oh.
Because he killed himself?

JAY:
After looking at the footage.

MIKE:
That's the producer who invested all of his money.
But he can't hurt Cory because it's just a memory and Cory is now a...

JAY:
A monster man.

MIKE:
A monster a-, uh, alien-angel.
"I'm taking you back to my spaceship, son of, son of Satan."
I will say, I doin't hate the makeup in this movie.

RICH:
No.

JAY:
No.
The makeup's a good, uh...

MIKE:
This, this son of Satan guy, he's pretty gross-looking.
He looks like a festering cold sore.
"Whee-e-e!"
Oh, my god.
Um...
"Not the gourd!"
Uh...

RICH:
I do think, I do th-, while the makeup itself isn't bad makeup, that they made him look like a Thermian was a weird choie.

MIKE;
Yes.
I, I, I...

JAY:
Especially since we don't know what he's actually supposed to be.

MIKE:
I was gonna say, yeah.
I would, I would offer suggestions of how they could've done it dfferently, but I don't know what he's supposed to be.

RICH:
He looks like he belongs on Babylon 5, and not in a horror movie.
He's, he's got angel in his bloodline.
He's a, he's a descendant of angels.

MIKE:
But if they're going...
Are they going for an, uh, angel in the...

RICH:
No.
I made that up.
But it makes sense.
And that's how you become an angel.

MIKE:
You gotta, you gotta connect all the...
Oh, my gosh.
He's flying.

JAY:
Oh, my lord.

MIKE:
He's the greatest American hero.
"Uh, which one's the last spell?"
"I don't know."
"Just read anything."

RICH:
"The one on the back page."

MIKE:
"Something'll work."
But the demons also have kind of those pointy elf ears...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So, like, I'm gonna go, he's the opposite of a demon, which, like you said, is an angel.
Maybe he can give 'em armor?
Like, you know, the archangel...

RICH:
Sure.
Sure.

MIKE:
Armor, right?
Or something like that?
A costume?

RiCH:
Glowing blue eyes.
That's fairly easy, right?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Or keep him looking exactly like this, and just have a line where someone says,
"Oh, he's transformed into an angel."
So we understand what's happening.

MIKE:
If there's one thing Satan can't stand, it's fire.

RICH:
"I knew that papier-mache fireplace was a fire hazard."

MIKE:
He just quantum leaped out of there.
"And he hoped this leap would be his leap home."
Oh, boy.
Right?

RICH:
Wasn't that, wasn't that the twist at the end of Quantum Leap, he's an angel?

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
More or less.

MIKE:
Yeah.
More or less.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Really?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
I don't remember that.

MIKE:
He ends up in an ethereal cafe, and God is the cafe owner.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And there's all the other leapers there.
And they're basically, like, angels...

JAY:
Huh.

MIKE:
That fly about through time and fix problems.

RICH:
So, are all of their friends burning in hell now?

MIKE:
Yes.
Cory feels real bad about inviting them.

RiCH:
Like, that sucks.

MIKE:
But, you know, they made it, right?

JAY:
Ugh!

MIKE:
And that's all that really matters.

JAY:
We were protected by this balsa wood.

MIKE:
"I'm no longer a bald Thermian."
And he kind of found out what happened to his grandparents.
So he feels, he feels, you know, satisfied.

RICH:
"I don't even know if it's started."
"It was a little bit confusing, honestly."

JAY:
"Especially towards the end there."

MIKE:
"Well, you just got all your friends killed, Cory."

JAY:
"You did it!"

MIKE:
"We need to talk about our relationship, Cory."
"I think, uh, I think it's best we both move on from each other."

JAY:
"So should we tell all of our friends's parents what happened?"

MIKE:
"Should we explain this to the police?"
What a prick.
He's smiling and laughing, like...

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And, and everyone's dead that he invited...

RICH:
Yep.

MIKE:
To go on this thing?
It's not, like, it was, like, a group deicsion to go on this trip to cabin in the woods, you know?

RICH:
Maybe, maybe they weren't his friends.
Maybe they were all her friends.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
No big loss.

RICH:
Yeah.
No big loss for him.

MIKE:
"Oh."
"Let's stop here."
"This place has provided us with no problems."

RICH:
"Let's go to the place that was owned by the man who was the son of the demon."

MIKE:
Literally became the son of the Devil.

RICH:
Gotta go back to the gas station.

MIKE:
The Pee-Wee's Playhouse door.
And they're gonna find lady.
Remember lady from the beginning, Rich?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
1940's lady.

JAY:
Harriet.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And she has, she is also a demon.

RICH:
Of course.

MIKE:
Although she wasn't stuck in the barn...

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
Like the other demons.
She got to live at the gas station.

JAY:
They, they defeated all the demons.
Except they didn't.

RICH:
She was aligned with Hard-, Hardcourt who may...

JAY:
"Hardcourt."

RICH:
Have been Anders's...

MIKE:
Harcourt.
Oh.
But see now the book, they no longer have to cast spells.
The just shoot...

JAY:
Just the existence of the book can kill demons now.

MIKE:
They can shoot lasers out, then send 'em to quantum leaps.

RICH:
Why did they go to the gas station in the first place?

JAY:
To, to kill her because they g-, I guess they knew she was a demon.

MIKE:
They highly suspected it.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
She was hanging out with Harcourt.
Although, see, they missed redheaded stepchild.

JAY:
They didn't notice this demon.
But now we know that demons are very easy to defeat, so it's not that big of a deal.

MIKE:
You just hold a book up at 'em.

JAY:
I, I guess.

MIKE:
And a He-Man laser comes out and zaps them into, into nowheres.

RICH:
Well, that's why the sequel will be more action-focused.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
It'll be, like, the aliens...

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
Of Demon Wind.

JAY:
"Demon Winds"?

RICH:
Demon Winds.
They go in with a team of, of marines.

JAY:
"We've detected multiple demon winds."

MIKE:
The th-, the marines of Thousand Oaks, California walk around with, with all these, uh, uh, books attached to the barrels of their guns.
They shoot blue lasers at demons.
I think that's, that, that could work.
Demon Winds.
Yeah.
Demon Winds.
"The demon winds are upon us."

JAY:
Although for a movie called Demon Wind, there's very little demon wind.

MIKE:
No.
You're wrong.
There was lots of demon wind.

JAY:
There was not any demon wind.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
There was demon fog.

MIKE:
Well...

JAY:
I guess you could say that's the, the representation of...

MIKE:
It's the demon wind.

JAY:
The wind.

RICH:
Demon fog is the representation of the demon wind.

JAY:
But even that isn't in it a whole lot.

MIKE:
That's your complaint about the movie?

JAY:
That's my, my only complaint.
Other than that, 10/10.

MIKE:
Okay.
Okay.
I'm, I'm very happy with the amount of demon wind in Demon Wind, okay?
That's not the problem.
The problem is everything else.

RICH:
Look.
I've seen so many horrible movies, I give this one a 3/10.

MIKE:
That's fair.
That's fair.

RICH:
I don't know.
Let's, let's go watch this again.

MIKE:
Do you think it'll make more sense if we watch it again?

RICH:
It might.
I mean, it's worth trying.

JAY:
I mean, you've watched it this...
If we watch it again, it'll be your 15th time.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
It'll only be my second time.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
But it might be helpful.
If we all collectively watch it multiple times, together we can figure it out.

RICH:
A sort of think tank.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I like it.
So what do we do for the rest of the credits?
Just sit here?

RICH:
I mean, yeah.
Why not?
I, I don't got anything better to do right now.

MIKE:
That's fair.

JAY:
"Specialty Parts".
He's where we don't get Lou Diamond Phillips in the credits.
For some reason, he didn't want his name on this.

RICH:
Which one was Woman Thing?

MIKE:
Whoa, look.
"Louis Gem Phips".

JAY:
Oh, that's him!

MIKE:
Louis Diamond, Gem.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And "Phillips" is "Phips".
Like...

RICH:
Oh, my god.
That's, that's it.
Let's work him in.

MIKE:
I found it.

JAY:
And then his wife left him for Melissa Etheridge.
"I was married to a second AD and all I got was Demon Wind."

MIKE:
Yeah.
She said,
"Come to my window."
Right?

JAY:
That's an alternate title for this movie, actually.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
There's a lot of that.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They use a cleverly, cleverly-hidden, uh, pseudonym in the cr-, end credits.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because he refused to have his name on this.

RICH:
Wise move.
Very wise move.
