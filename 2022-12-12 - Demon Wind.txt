MIKE:
So, guys.
What are we watching today?

JAY:
I don't know.
It's just a black screen right now.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
But I'm, I'm very, uh, very anxious.

MIKE:
What does it say, Rich?

RICH:
It says "Demon Wind".

JAY:
Demon Wind?

RICH:
Oh.
I can hear wind.
That's the Demon Wind.

MIKE:
Are you sure it's not an unrelated wind?
Oh, my goodness gracious.

JAY:
Ugh.
My grandfather went the exact same way.

MIKE:
Somebody got burnt on a cross in 1931.

JAY:
It was a lot more common back then, right?

MIKE:
Uh, I don't know.

JAY:
It's, really, it's like the equivalent of a lawn flamingo in 1931.
It's why the Homeowner's Association started.
To stop all those lawn crucifixions.

MIKE:Oh, my god.
"I thought I told you before.""Keep Fluffy in her cage at night."

JAY:This is the worst family barbecue ever.

MIKE:
I, I figured out the, the family lineage by the way, gentlemen.
I've seen this film...

JAY:Of this movie we haven't watched?

MIKE:
I, I've seen the film before, uh, 14 different times.

JAY:Oh, my god.You've seen Demon Wind 14 times.

MIKE:Yes.
And you guys...

RICH:So it has to be really good then?

MIKE:Well, no...

JAY:I can't wait.

MIKE:
I, I've watched it 14 times so I could figure out what the fuck is going on.

JAY:I'm sorry.
What was that?
I wasn't listening.

MIKE:Having a fireplace made out of cardboard and, and paper doesn't seem like the best idea.
"Jesus was always my favorite family member."

JAY:So what relation is Jesus?MIKE:That's their Uncle Jesus.

JAY:Great Uncle Jesus?

MIKE:Jesus, ironically, all of his photos are in color.
But all the people born in 1931, all their photos are in black and white.
I don't know how they achieved this technological achi-, marvel.
"Would it hurt you to smile, grandma?"
"You're in Demon Wind."
"Your career is going places."
"Uncle Jesus, the college years."
Oh.
It's my favorite song.
Washed in the blood of the lamb by Styx.

RICH:That's what you got?

MIKE:Uh, yeah.
Th-, they like their candles.
I guess, uh, their wicker baskets.

JAY:They love the Jesus.

MIKE:The Jesus protects the house when, except for the fact that it, he doesn't protect the house.
Candles.
Glass jars.
Religious photos.
Wicker baskets.
Oh.
Now I know where my thrift store got all of its merchandise.

RICH:That's what you got?

MIKE:Oh, my god.
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
No one showed up.
The one guy that did show up, they burned down a cross.

JAY:Help me, Jesus.
I'm watching Demon Wind.

MIKE:It's kind of funny.
They, they've k-, they have all this religious pic-, all these religious pictures, you know?
All, they have all these pictures of Jesus, but they never once, like, mention Jesus in any of their spells.
It's not religious, you know, towards the end, Jay.
We've seen it...

JAY:
Oh.
You've, you've seen this movie before?

MIKE:I've seen this movie before Rich and Jay.

JAY:So you've paid to see it again in a theater, huh?

MIKE:I did.

JAY:
That's...

RICH:
Well, then it's gotta be good, right?

JAY:
I, I'm assuming so, yeah.
We'll find out.

MIKE:"Rosebud."

JAY:"Demon Wind."

MIKE:Oh, my god.
Out of all that religious shit, they, they didn't even have a good cross to use?
They had to make it out of, like, cardboard?

JAY:Well, they spent all their money on the Jesus pictures.

MIKE:Oh.
Those boards are nailed to the door.
That literally does nothing.
They, you know what I mean?
Do, do you know what I'm saying, Rich?

RICH:I know what you're saying.

MIKE:They're just nailed to the door.
They're not, they're not keeping the, the...
Oh.
I guess a little bit goes on the frame, but...

JAY:A couple of them are on the frame.

MIKE:Yeah.
I guess they...
Okay.
I take it back.

RICH:I mean, it would keep you from pulling the door out.

MIKE:Sure.
But, you know what?
In my personal experience, if a demon wants to get in your house, nothing's gonna stop it, you know?

RICH:Did Zak Bagans tell you that?

MIKE:He did.
Yeah.
"You always told me you liked my cooking."
He's just, uh, having a diabetic reaction to her Christmas cookies.
This is what happens when Rich eats fish.
"I told you I was allergic to your green bean casserole."

RICH:He just went to the gym with John Travolta.

MIKE:
I don't understand that joke at all, but...

JAY:I think I do, and I don't like it.

MIKE:Does John Travolta have diseases?
I don't understand your joke, Rich.

JAY:I think it was a semen joke.

MIKE:Oh!
Oh!
Like, thatk's what was coming out of his mouth?
All curdled and disgusting and filled with blood?

JAY:Well, that's what Hollywood does to you.
Are you sure we're not watching David Lynch's Dune?
This is the baron, right?

MIKE:"Oh, here.""Drink this snow globe."
"It's got Benadryl..."

JAY:"Drink this snow globe."

MIKE:"It's got, it's got Benadryl in it."
This, now this snow globe is magic, Rich.
For no reason at all.As she breaks the snow globe.

JAY:It's a Jesus snow globe.

MIKE:
The curse is broken, or something.
I guess it's filled with gasoline.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Although this is only their second-worst Thanksgiving ever.

RICH:
I don't know.
I'm, I'm not liking this gritty Citizen Kane remake.

JAY:Is that the end of the movie?

MIKE:No.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:
'Ladies and gentlemen, Ireland's most advanced expressway."
Not bad.
Pretty good?

JAY:"Not bad."

MIKE:
As soon as we meet our hero, Cory, I'll explain to you the lineage...
Or you guys just ask me.
I mean, this is the premise.
Uh, he's driving, uh, he's taking his girlfriend...
What the hell's her name?
Diane or something?
I don't know.
Lily Rabe.

JAY:Bea Arthur?

MIKE:He's driving her...
Oh.
Here's a flashback.
He's driving her to visit, to find her grandparents's, uh, farm, farmhouse.
And now this is Cory's dad.He hasn't seen his dad his whole life, and he decides to look him up and visit him.
And then the very next day after being visited by his son, Cory, his dad kills himself.

JAY:So, pretty standard Christmas?

MIKE:I mean...

JAY:Maybe he killed himself...

MIKE:Can you blame him?

JAY:Because he lived in a cardboard apartment building.

MIKE:Yeah.
Right.
Or Cory told  him he was gonna pursue acting.
"I"m in this new film called Demon Wind."

JAY:"Fuck this!"Slit.

RICH:"I can't live with the shame."

MIKE:
"I can't live with the shame of your career."
Uh, but he hasn't told his girlfriend about that his father killed himself.
All he told her is,
"Listen.""We, we gotta go find my grandparents's farm."
"And, and I'm gonna invite twelve of my whitest friends to come along so they can be killed off one-by-one by demons."

JAY:I mean, it sounds like a fun group activity.

RICH:
I think a couple more of them could've rode within that car.

MIKE:Yeah.Saved on gas?

RICH:Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
No room.
The backseat was taken up with all of his emotional baggage.

MIKE:
"Parents."
"It's 10 am."
"Do you know where your neglected redheaded stepchild is?"
Oh, my god.
You're not gonna toiuch the car with that stick.
It's just not gonna happen.
Also, they invented soap.
That little girl.
Get in the bathtub.Unless you're a ghost.
Do you think she's a ghost?

JAY:I don't know.There, there's no indication that she is or isn't.

MIKE:She looks like she could be inbred, though.

JAY:Mike, that's very rude.

MIKE:
That's why I thought this was Ireland.
There's some, some scummy, dirty Irish child in the shop.
You know what I mean?
Unwashed Irish is just in their shot.

JAY:Do you just assume that they don't take baths in Ireland?

MIKE:I don't know.I don't know much about Ireland.
Isn't driving fun?
Don't you love watching people drive somewhere, Rich, in a film?
RICH:It's kind of...I mean, it kind of works in Cannonball Run.

JAY:Would you say Demon Wind is the Cannonball Run of horror films?

RICH:I think that's a very accurate statement, yes.

MIKE:
It kind of sounded like you said Cannibal Run.

JAY:I did the first time.

MIKE:No, Rich.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:So, we're gonna, we're gonna workshop that later, okay?

RICH:Can-, Cannibal Run?

JAY:Cannibal Run's a good name for a horror film.

MIKE:But first, we gotta talk about this gas station.
And this very common dream that I've had.
I don't know about you guys.

RICH:
It's being naked at a gas station you've never been to before?

MIKE:Right.
While holding a...
What is he holding?

JAY:I think he's there for a lube job.

MIKE:Oh.
Oh, yeah.
You're naked at a gas station and your bloody mother comes out and laughs at you.
I've had this dream before.
Oh.
That's not his mother.That's his grandmother.

RICH:Yes.

MIKE:Would you like me to talk about the lineage yet?

RICH:Why don't you, why don't you please tell me about the lineage?

MIKE:Well, they're about to go inside the gas station, though.
And that's some of the best scenes in the film.
Because we get to see the paper mache gas station.

RICH:All right.
We just have the naked dream.That's pretty exciting.

MIKE:I'll wait till the next driving scene, okay?
To talk about the lineage.
Because I still don't understand it.

RICH:Wait.There's more than one driving scene?

MIKE:Yes.

RICH:Oh, my god.

MIKE:There's lots of driving and walking and waiting.

RICH:But why?MIKE:That was the original title of the film.
"This road is really doing a number on my hemorrhoids."
Oh.
See.
They spot the gas station from the top of the hill, then they take the car three miles an hour to the gas station so that we can wait even longer for them to get there.
This is where he chose to put his gas station?

RICH:This does seem like a terrible location.

MIKE:"Oh, thank god."
"I haven't had a customer since 1952."

JAY:There's not even, like, a gravel parking lot.

MIKE:No.

JAY:It's just in the middle of a field.

MIKE:Because it's fake.
It's a fake gas station, Jay.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:There's literally no infrastructure around to, where they could fill the gas tanks up under the ground or anything.

RICH:
But it's, it's a spooky supernatural gas station, Mike.
It shouldn't be there!

MIKE:Maybe if that, if it's a ghost gas station, perhaps.
But I think they just didn't want to film at a real gas station.
You know, so they just made one.
The first time I saw this film, I thought it was gonna blow up, you know?
It's like when they have an old car in the middle of a field.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
You know it's coming.

RICH:
This film was, this film was destined to flop.

MIKE:What?

RICH:There's no way this was gonna blow up.

MIKE:No.
No.
The gas station, not the film.
"There's no such place as a barber shop, either."
"So don't go looking for that."
Do you think these gas pumps actually work?

JAY:Do you think these actors actually work?

MIKE:Not anymore.
Not after Demon Wind came out.
If you had a dream where you were naked, and your mother was bloodied with her throat ripped open, would you stop at this gas station?I probably wouldn't.
I'd skip it.

JAY:
I mean, they gotta window made out of whitie duct tape.

MIKE:It looks like Pee-Wee's Playhouse.
It's like that junky-looking.

JAY:
And, Rich, this is a gas station, not a high school play set.
I guess this movie takes place in a world where all the buildings are constructed from paper mache.

MIKE:Jay, it's plywood.
Okay?

JAY:
Well, the, the window on that door is definitely made of white duct tape.

MIKE:
It's like a, it's like, like plastic tarp.
And that's, like, cardboard.
"Oh."
"I picked the wrong boyfriend."
"Now, what should I order?"
"Hey, lady."
"The bathroom's out back."

RICH:
No.
He was the one that was naked in the dream.

JAY:Oh.
She's gonna release some demon wind.

MIKE:Oh, no.
Uh...

JAY:This is very common behavior.
It's very realistic.

RICH:This is what the "humans" do.

JAY:Was this movie made by the demon wind?

RICH:
Maybe they're on their "honeymoon"?

MIKE:I'm afraid the character made a joke about that already.
He says something about a moon.
I think it's a quote from something.
"Ooh!""I'll take the goats milk!"
This lady looks like she's from 1940 or '30.
Is she a ghost?

RICH:I think she's a ghost.

MIKE:You think?

RICH:Yeah.

MIKE:Or a demon?
A demon disguised as a person?

RICH:I think she's a demon ghost from the 1950's, from grandma's time.

MIKE:Do you think they're turning a profit with those $0.50 fish burgers?

RICH:Well, I mean, nobody drives by there for gas, so they gotta supplement their income somehow.

MIKE:
Do you think the gas pumps even work?

RICH:No.

MIKE:They're just there for show?
Like a decoration?

RICH:To entice you to come in and get a sandwich.

MIKE:Right.
A fish burger.

JAY:To get a fish burger.

MIKE:
Or barbecue.

JAY:A barbecued fish burger?

MIKE:
Sure, why not?

RICH:"Hey, I need some gas."
"Our gas pumps don't work, but come on, have a fish burger while you're here."

MIKE:"And some goats milk."
I, I, I still don't understand why Dell kisses her on the mouth.

JAY:
Mike, they're a very close group of friends.

MIKE:That's a little, it's a little, uh, you know, that's, like, his best buddy's girlfriend, and he just kisses her on the fucking mouth.

RICH:He's the asshole.
His character is the asshole.

MIKE:Well, then he starts smooching her.
And his line is,"That's why I keep her around."
He says it three times.
I don't know.

RICH:He's the asshole.

MIKE:
He, Dell just spreads around herpes amongst everybody.
Now, Cory has invited, uh, eleven of his white friends to go with him to his haunted grandparents's cabin for no reason at all.
Perhaps for them to get killed off.
I don't know.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:Or turned into demons.

JAY:They're there for emotional support.
Who knows what they're gonna find at this abandoned cabin that somebody died at 60 years earlier.
MIKE:Yeah.
I don't really...

JAY:You, you need 25 of your, your, uh, 40-year old high school friends.

RICH:
Was that, was that...

MIKE:"Thanks for coming with me on this very, very vague mission, um..."
"I'll tell you all about it when we get to the, the demonically-possessed burnt down cabin."
"Then I'll tell you all about why you're here."
"I'm in."
"Sign me up, Cory."
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

JAY:
Uh, I mean, the important part is that, uh, he, he invited his entire high school class to come hang out at the cabin with him, for some reason.

MIKE:Right.
His 90's friends.

JAY:
"I'll tell you all about my family's depressing history over a couple of fish burgers."

MIKE:Over some cokes and a Milwaukee's Best.
"No, we don't drink that filth."

JAY:Has there ever been a more ironically titled beer?

MIKE:No.
I suppose not.
JAY:"Oh, we're just down here talking about your dick."

MIKE:So I guess...
Oh.
She date-, she must've dated him.
The blonde who's date-, who's Cor-, who's Cory's girlfriend?
Because they were talking about Dell's penis size.
Oh, her name's Elaine, by the way.

RICH:
The girlfriend?

MIKE:Her.
Elaine.

RICH:Yeah.

MIKE:Uh, I, and her and, uh, I think her name's, uh, um, oh, Barbara, or fucking something like that?
Betsy?
I wrote it down.
Hold on.
Give me a minute.
I gotta go through my notes.

JAY:I"ll give you several minutes.

MIKE:Uh...
She's the only who showed up for the cast and crew interviews on the Blu-ray.

JAY:Oh, yeah?

MIKE:
Um...

RICH:Everyone else killed themselves.

MIKE:Ah, geez.

JAY:So the sequel to this movie is gonna be meta, and it's gonna be the filmmakers traveling to this cabin to find out why the actors killed themselves?

RICH:"My grandpa made Demon Wind here 30 years ago."

MIKE:That would be difficult.

JAY:"The next day, he killed himself."
MIKE:"The next day..."
All the demons, the undead demons are people that attended the premier.
"There was a fire at the premier of Demon Wind."
I keep hoping something different happens every time I watch the movie.
Like it'll change, you know?

JAY:Like Clue?

MIKE:Like Clue, yeah.

JAY:
When that was released in theaters, and had different endings?

MIKE:Right.

JAY:One of these days, you'll walk into the theater to watch Demon Wind, and it'll be the ending that makes sense.

MIKE:Yeah.
I keep buying Blu-rays, hoping, like, a new Blu-ray will be different.
And I'm, and I'm always hoping that at some point of, of Demon Wind, someone orders the fish burger for $0.50.

JAY:
Is that on the menu?

MIKE:
It's on the menu.

JAY:There's a fish burger?

MIKE:It's all...
There's no, there's no, uh...
The menu's quite fascinating.
There's no vegetarian options.
It's, it's all, like, weird disgusting food that cost $0.50.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:
See.
Oh.

JAY:Oh, yeah.
Pastrami.Ham sandwich.
Fish burger!

MIKE:Fish burger.
Hot link sandwich.
Uh...
Oh, can we get back to the menu?
Okay.Fried chicken.
Barbecue beef sandwich.Uh, so they have a lot of meat, meat options.
And that's it.
And nobody paid for their cokes or,or their beer.
Originally, I thought it was Ireland, but it was shot in Thousand Oaks, California, outside of Los Angeles by the roll, rolling hills of Thousand Oaks, California.Which is doubling for some kind of country area somewhere.
It's rather vague.

JAY:A Thousand Oaks?
Is what it's called?

MIKE:Thousand Oaks...

JAY:Thousand Oaks

MIKE:California.
It's a city.

JAY:That's where a thousand, uh, struggling actors live.

MIKE:
Oh.
Thou-, a thousand jokes?
That's what we got for you on this commentary track, ladies and gentlemen.

JAY:Commentary track?
We're in a movie theater.

MIKE:Sorry.That's what we should say while we're in this movie theater as aliens.

JAY:It's a good thing that there's no other people watching this movie, or they'd be very upset that we keep talking over it.

MIKE:Right.They would miss the plot.
Anyways, whenever you guys are ready, I could tell you the lineage.

RICH:Yes.
I'm ready right now to know the lineage of these characters I don't care about.

MIKE:
Well, it's not, it's not so much about these characters.
It's more of the backstory...

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:Of the entire premise of the film.
But here, our harbinger of doom is warning them to go, not go to the cabin.
Even though at the end of the film -- spoilers -- he is an insane priest, uh, and who turns into the son of Satan and his legion of demons are there.
So you think he would want to add more to his legion of demons by luring these unsuspected, unsuspecting kids to their, the grandparents's farm to be turned into demons, right?
Instead of warning them away.
Right, Rich?

RICH:
It's reverse psychology.
It was very effective.

MIKE:Okay.
You think, you think he was going for reverse psychology?

JAY:Oh, no.
Who invited Dracula?

MIKE:Rich, more friends are showing up.
These are the magician friends.

RICH:Do, do we, do we need more friends?

MIKE:No.
Or, or magicians.
These are, this is the early roles for Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon as man in a dracula costume?

JAY:He's a magician!
That's a magician's cape.

MIKE:It'sl...
Okay.
Sure.

JAY:Harcourt is not impressed.
Now, Mike, you've seen this before, right?

MIKE:Yes, I have.

JAY:You've seen this 14 times before?

MIKE:Yes.Yes, I have.

JAY:Uh, I'm assuming, like, they're really hammering it in that this guy's a magician.
I'm assuming that's going to pay off later, right?

MIKE:
Uh, the, no.The kicking pays off.
He's a, he's a kung fu magician.
Rich, look.

RICH:Oh, my god.I saw you, I saw you do that.

MIKE:Yeah, he's...

RICH:
You did that thing.
Earlier today.

JAY:Were you trying to re-enact this movie?

MIKE:I was.
The famous can-kicking scene.

JAY:It's a staple of most magic acts.

MIKE:And I don't know why anyone would show up in a tuxedo doing magic tricks when you're going on a quest to find your friend's dead grandparents's burned down cabin.

JAY:Apparently, he brought a rabbit with him, too, just to do this one trick.

MIKE:Actually, he just did the smoke bomb thing, and then the rabbit happened to be there.
JAY:Oh.

MIKE:
So it's, like, fortuitous, you know?

JAY:Wow.That's great.

RICH:He has dozens of rabbits on his person at all times just in case something comes up.

JAY:You never know.

MIKE:Rich, it's Sean Penn, not Richard Gere.

JAY:Are they both magicians?
Or is this the magician's assistant, and they couldn't get an actress?

RICH:There can be two magicians.

JAY:I disagree.

MIKE:I, I honestly, I don't know.
I was surprised to find that this was, uh, a film made in the US.
I mean, it has all the markings of, like, a weird Italian movie.

JAY:Trying to make something American.

MIKE:Yeah.

JAY:Magic!

MIKE:But it was shot in Los Angeles by people in the Hollywood system.
Low-budget, of course, but...

RICH:They didn't even know?

JAY:
No.
They've all been driving for hours to go to an undisclosed location for unknown reasons.

RICH:These are some good fucking friends.

MIKE:There's not much to do in this, uh...
Well, I don't know where they're all from.
I don't think the movie ever tells us.

RICH:"I drove four hours to be here.""What's going on?"

MIKE:"And I wore my best tuxedo and Dracula cape."

JAY:Well, I recognize the magician.
He's the only actor in the film I recognize.
And it's not because he looks like Kevin Bacon.
He's in the film Shock 'Em Dead where he played a nerd turned rock 'n roller.

MIKE:Oh, yeah.

JAY:That, that has to eat souls.

MIKE:Did we watch that?

JAY:We've seen that film, yeah.
With Traci Lords.

MIKE:Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's funny, because...

JAY:"Son of a bitch and idiots."That sounds like an Italian, uh...

MIKE:"Son of a bitch and idiots."
JAY:Something an Italian would write.

MIKE:Yeah.
I was gonna say, it's funny, because there's also a porno actress in this, too.

JAY:There is?

MIKE:Yeah.

JAY:Is it the old man?

MIKE:
No.
The nudity lady who comes out of the woods and, and kind of lures them out of the house.
Remember?

JAY:Oh.
No, I don't remember, because this is the first time I've seen this.

MIKE:And I think all...

JAY:You're the only one who's seen it multiple times now.

MIKE:I think I looked up all these actors on, like, IMDB, and almost every one of them ended up in porn after this.

JAY:Well, you know...

MIKE:Whether it's softcore...
Remember all those softcore programs?
The Red Shoe Diaries.

JAY:Oh, sure.

MIKE:
Passion something.
All those n-, all those titles were coming up.
All those Skinemax late night Skinemax flicks that Rich would tape on a VCR and label as "football game".
I knew what you were up to back in the day.
Why do you have so many VHS tapes labeled "football game"?
"Football game 1."
"Football game 2."
Ahh...

RICH:That was the sticky one.

JAY:"All right, everyone."
"We're back on the road."
"If anyone spots the plot, let me know."

MIKE:Did they just throw garbage out of the car?

RICH:
They just, no.d
They just threw out their magician uniforms.

MIKE:Oh.
Because they realized they weren't going to, like, a resort with people.

RICH:Yeah.
But those probably were expensive.
I, I mean, that Dracula suit looked like a fairly nice Dracula suit.

JAY:You would think, if he wants to be a professional magician, he would want to hold onto that.
Even if he's not gonna use it this weekend.

RICH:It's, it's the magician code, Jay.
You're only allowed to use your outfit once.

JAY:Then it must be destroyed.

RICH:Yes.

JAY:Do you think, like, some horror movies are made just as an excuse to, you know, film a movie with, like, gore, maybe some nudity.
Was this movie just as an excuse to film people driving?

MIKE:
And they found an egg with a bunch of maggots in it.

RICH:Well, they didn't find it.
It's just sitting there off to the side.
They never saw it.

MIKE:
Oh.
It accidentally got in the shot?

RICH:Yeah.

MIKE:Okay.
Anway.
Oh.
Should I tell you all about the history?

RICH:Yes, Mike.
Please tell me all about the history.
I'm waiting.

JAY:We got time.

MIKE:
We need context.
Okay.
So June 8th, 1929.
Cory's father was born.
Should I go, should I go chronologically here?

RICH:Yes, you probably should.

MIKE:The Cor-, the farm...
Oh.
Oh.
I think I'm gonna have to wait.
Oh, look.
The grade school kids were doing Shakespeare in the park.
JAY:Is this skeleton a part of the family lineage?

MIKE:Uh, I don't know who the skeleton is.

JAY:That's his Uncle Remus.

RICH:I can't believe they left that up there for 30 years.

JAY:More than 30.

RICH:
More than 30, yes.

JAY:30 years ago is when grand...
Oh.
No.
Who died 30 years ago, Mike?
MIKE:I, I have it all. I have it all written out.

JAY:I, I, I...
You know, you keep saying that.

RICH:
I don't beileve him

MIKE:I think the skeleton was burnt in 1931 in the opening of the film.

JAY:
That's what we saw in the opening, yeah.

MIKE:So this is...
The movie came out in 1990, so we're gonna assume it's 1990.

JAY:Okay.

MIKE:Uh, which is...

JAY:
So it's 60 years.

MIKE:
60...
Skeleton's been up there for 60 years.
And as Rich, you noted before, the ligaments that hold the bones together have not been burnt or rotted away.

RICH:Yes.

MIKE:
The skeleton remains intact.

RICH:
It's kind of amazing.

MIKE:Yeah.
It does.
It just doesn't fall into pieces.
I guess there's no police in Ireland.
Or no one drives down this road ever.
I don't know.

RICH:Like, literally ever.

JAY:Does this take place in Ireland?
I know you said it was shot in California.

MIKE:No.
I was just joking around because it looks like Ireland.

JAY:Do they say where it's supposed to take place.

MIKE:They...don't.
I think, I think we'd like to talk now about the set and, um, and wh-, what all this is before I get into the lineage.

JAY:Okay.

MIKE:I may not have time to squeeze it in.
Oh, my god.
"What's the fucking problem, Bonnie?"
"You're studying to be an anthropologist."

RICH:
Oh, no.

MIKE:Oh, my god.
That's, that was Skeletor's brother.

RICH:There's information we're getting here.
It's all completely irrelevant, isn't it?

MIKE:Well, okay.So this guy here is, is Cory's dad's brother.
Now let me, let me, let me get into the lineage here.

JAY:
Okay.
I'm, I'm waiting.

MIKE:Okay.

JAY:I'm very excited.

MIKE:So the film opens in 1931.

RICH:Uh-huh.

MIKE:And there's a body being burnt on a cross.
I don't know why.
But the, the two people we see in the opening of the film are Regina and George, which are the grandparents of Cory.

RICH:Yes.

MIKE:But that's not where the story starts.
RICH:Oh, my god.

MIKE:The story really starts in the 1800's.The farm was built by Cory's great-grandparents.
Uh, and they followed a guy named Anders who decided to start a satanic cult.
Uh, and the satanic cult killed three little girls.
And then the townsfolk gathered up all the satantic cult members and burned them all to death, potentially on this land.

RICH:
Ah.

MIKE:Sort of like a, a Freddy Krueger'ish kind of axe, right?

RICH:Yeah.

MIKE:And they said,
"We don't want your satanic cult here."
Uh, and then flash-forward to 1931.
C-, the, Cory, Cory's, uh, uh, grandp-, uh, grandparents live on the farm.
Um, I, I have to stop because we have to talk about this.
Now watch this magic, Rich.
Wha?
Why do you think they did that?
I'm gonna give you 14 guesses.
Okay.Watch this, though.
Watch this.
Ready?Ready?Watch this.
Now...

JAY:They did it because it's magical and weird and creepy.

MIKE:
Now, see...Watch, Rich.
Watch.
Are you watching?

RICH:I'm watching.
I actually find this...
This is interesting right now.
The way she doesn't see him.That's great.

MIKE:No.

JAY:
Is it, what's it, why is it happening?

MIKE:So they could film on a sound stage.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:You know why, Jay.

JAY:Is it like,
"Oh, we already wrote our opening scene where the cabin blows up, but we have to have somewhere for our characters to go?"
So they'll just go to the remnants of the cabin...

MIKE:I think the idea was that the...

JAY:
And magic happens?

RICH:Just, just change the opening scene.
I'm assuming they didn't have a good exterior where they could film at.
They didn't know where to find...

MIKE:Yeah.

RICH:Cabin in the woods.

JAY:Yeah.

MIKE:That's, that's, yes.Exactly.
They, they wanted to make Evil Dead.
And they, they wanted a cabin in the woods in, in deep forest at night.Dark spooky forest with, with smoke and moonlight.

JAY:Instead, they don't have a cabin or woods.

MIKE:Right.
So they had Thousand Oaks, California.
Rolling hills and 70-degree temperatures and no woods around.
They'd have to drive pretty far out of the Los Angeles area to find, like, spooky woods.
So they just set up, like, junk in the middle of nowhere, and then they go inside a magical cabin.

JAY:And they, they use an existing set built for some high school production for their main location.

MIKE:Right.
Oh, look, Rich.
Magic.

JAY:Seamless.

MIKE:
I think you meant "seamfull".

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:And there's grandma.
So...

JAY:"She looks just how I remember her."

MIKE:Her head fell off and she started on fire when the house blew up.
But the house is still there, but grandma's burnt up bones.

JAY:
No one ever cleared it out, I guess.

MIKE:Nobody ever poked around here.
The cops never showed up.

JAY:Then again, we are in a magical interior...

MIKE:Yes.

JAY:That doesn't really exist.

MIKE:What, would, like, a police officer that drove to investigate the skeleton on a cross, like...

RICH:Why, why does this look so bad?

MIKE:Because it's an optical effect.

RICH:But that should be the easiest effect to do and have it be pretty seamless, right?
Just put a camera on a fucking tripod.

MIKE:Well, they did.

JAY:Well, they did that.
But when, back in the days of film, you would have a little bit of fluttering in the film.

MIKE:
The film, yeah.
RICH:Okay.
Okay.

MIKE:No, no.
Don't do that.

JAY:Oh, no.
The paper mache fireplace.

MIKE:
If you see creepy Latin written in blood on the wall, don't read it aloud.
Rich, she just woke up the demons.
The firecrackers are going off all over the place.
And blow up all the Jesus pictures.
But, um, I listened to the commentary from the DP.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:And most of the movie was shot on, uh, short ends.

JAY:Oh.

MIKE:And of all sorts of different film stocks and brands.

JAY:Okay.

MIKE:
And they were all, like, mislabeled and, and so they had different, like, film stocks.
And they, like, sent them off to the lab, and they would come back, like, like, black.
They were like,
"No, no, no."
"Sorry.""That's, that's a, that's a fast speed film stock."
JAY:Oh, Jesus.

MIKE:And so, the, you, you'll notice it, uh, certain shots look, like, nice and clean.
And then towards the end of the film, they ran out of short ends, and they had to buy brand new film stock.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:So certain shots look really nice.
Some shots look crappy.
And, Rich, to explain what a short end is...

RICH:
That's the unused bits at the end of film?

MIKE:Yes.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:Uh, from a real production when, they're, they're...

RICH:Yeah.

MIKE:They're almost...

JAY:Hey, now.
Are you saying Demon Wind is not a real production?

MIKE:I am.

RICH:Yes.

JAY:Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
They had...

JAY:Just making sure.

MIKE:
"Uh, we got, uh, 50 feet left on this, this roll."
"Just change it out."

RICH:"We didn't use it on Back to the Future."

MIKE:Yes.

RICH:"Ehh, we're gonna give it to Demon Wind."

MIKE:
Yes.
You go to the film people and go,
"Do you have any short ends?"
"Sure!"
"Here's a whole ton of 'em!"
And then you load up the camera with, with a little bit of footage, and then we got one shot where Dell pokes his head out of the car and says,
"My car won't start."
You know, that's all you need.

JAY:
You get one take.

MIKE:Yep.
So it was, it was kind of a, a mess.
Buit, uh, considering, it looks pretty good.

JAY:Sure.
Most of it looks fine.

MIKE:
So the demons, uh, are stopping their cars from starting, right?
RICH:Mm-hmm.

MIKE:Demons won't let the batteries start the car.
That's what's going on.

JAY:it's a weird thing to say, but...

MIKE:"You're not gonna die, Bonnie."
"You're espeically not going to turn into a plastic doll and then start on fire."
"I'm almost certain that's not gonna happen to you, Bonnie."
"That will be very strange.""Then I wouldn't have to bury you, right?"
"So I promise that I won't bury you, Bonnie."
"Because I woin't have to bury you if you turn if you turn into a plastic doll and then start on fire."
Oh.
Back to the lineage.
So, 1890's.
Satanic cult.
Farm got all burnt up.
Flash-foward to 1931.
Cory's grandparents are there.
It says Mrs. James, which I think is Cory's grandma, had triplets.
They were killed right after birth.They weren't even human.
All the children were the same except for Cory's dad.

RICH:Okay.

JAY:
Why was he different?

MIKE:
I don't know.
And then Cory's dad also had an older brother, which is the kid they show running up and spitting blood up.

JAY:
Spitting out blood, yeah.

MIKE:So I guess she had five...

RICH:Yes.

MIKE:Kids?
And the triplets...
I don't understand it.

RICH:She had two normal kids and three demon babies.
I get it.
I get it.

JAY:
But the dialogue says she had four kids, and one of them was Cory's dad, right?

MIKE:Mrs. James had triplets.

JAY:Triplets.
Okay.MIKE:Killed right after birth.
They wasn't even human.
Uh, and that's it.
So his dad survived out of all the kids, I guess.
Oh.The dad was in, um, an incubator during the events of the opening.
He was born in 1929.
The explosion and the demon attack happened in 1931.

JAY:Yeah.

MIKE:So he was three years old and still in an incubator at the hospital.
And that's why his dad was able to survive.
