MIKE:
So, guys.
What are we watching today?

JAY:
I don't know.
It's just a black screen right now.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
But I'm, I'm very, uh, very anxious.

MIKE:
What does it say, Rich?

RICH:
It says "Demon Wind".

JAY:
Demon Wind?

RICH:
Oh.
I can hear wind.
That's the Demon Wind.

MIKE:
Are you sure it's not an unrelated wind?
Oh, my goodness gracious.

JAY:
Ugh.
My grandfather went the exact same way.

MIKE:
Somebody got burnt on a cross in 1931.

JAY:
It was a lot more common back then, right?

MIKE:
Uh, I don't know.

JAY:
It's, really, it's like the equivalent of a lawn flamingo in 1931.
It's why the Homeowner's Association started.
To stop all those lawn crucifixions.

MIKE:Oh, my god.
"I thought I told you before.""Keep Fluffy in her cage at night."

JAY:This is the worst family barbecue ever.

MIKE:
I, I figured out the, the family lineage by the way, gentlemen.
I've seen this film...

JAY:Of this movie we haven't watched?

MIKE:
I, I've seen the film before, uh, 14 different times.

JAY:Oh, my god.You've seen Demon Wind 14 times.

MIKE:Yes.
And you guys...

RICH:So it has to be really good then?

MIKE:Well, no...

JAY:I can't wait.

MIKE:
I, I've watched it 14 times so I could figure out what the fuck is going on.

JAY:I'm sorry.
What was that?
I wasn't listening.

MIKE:Having a fireplace made out of cardboard and, and paper doesn't seem like the best idea.
"Jesus was always my favorite family member."

JAY:So what relation is Jesus?MIKE:That's their Uncle Jesus.

JAY:Great Uncle Jesus?

MIKE:Jesus, ironically, all of his photos are in color.
But all the people born in 1931, all their photos are in black and white.
I don't know how they achieved this technological achi-, marvel.
"Would it hurt you to smile, grandma?"
"You're in Demon Wind."
"Your career is going places."
"Uncle Jesus, the college years."
Oh.
It's my favorite song.
Washed in the blood of the lamb by Styx.

RICH:That's what you got?

MIKE:Uh, yeah.
Th-, they like their candles.
I guess, uh, their wicker baskets.

JAY:They love the Jesus.

MIKE:The Jesus protects the house when, except for the fact that it, he doesn't protect the house.
Candles.
Glass jars.
Religious photos.
Wicker baskets.
Oh.
